  "summary": "The H2Q (Hierarchical Heterogeneous Quaternion) framework models AGI cognition as a unitary geodesic flow on an SU(2) manifold, isomorphic to the unit 3-sphere (S³). Mathematical coherence is maintained through three foundational pillars: 1. **Fractal Expansion Protocol**, which utilizes recursive symmetry breaking (h ± δ) to evolve 2-atom seeds into 256-dimensional topological knots. 2. **Holomorphic Auditing**, employing the Discrete Fueter Operator (Df) and 4th-order Fueter-Laplace biharmonic operators to detect 'topological tears' (logic curvature > 0.05) representing hallucinations. 3. **Spectral Tracking (η)**, where the Krein-like trace formula η = (1/π) arg{det(S)} quantifies learning progress against environmental drag μ(E). Memory persistence for 100M+ token context is achieved via Recursive Sub-Knot Hashing (RSKH) and Manual Reversible Kernels (Additive Coupling), ensuring O(1) activation memory complexity optimized for Mac Mini M4 register constraints.",
