# Legacy / Reference Files

The current runtime entrypoints are fully unified on h2q_project/h2q_server.py and tools/unified_audit.py. The following legacy snapshots have been removed to avoid confusion:

- h2q_project/h2q_server_refactored.py — removed; superseded by h2q_project/h2q_server.py.
- test_refactored_server.py — removed legacy test harness; not part of the unified audit or runtime.

Use the documented commands in AGI_QUICK_START.md to run the FastAPI service, experiments, and the unified audit.
