Then 1.2x = 48.  Solving for x, x = 48 / 1.2 = 40.\n\n2. **Ranked:**\n   * **2 (40):** This is the correct answer, so it has the highest confidence.\n   * **0 (105):** This is a plausible incorrect answer.\n   * **1 (5600):** This is a very unlikely answer.\n   * **3 (5):** This is a very unlikely answer.\n\n3. **Selected:**  We select the top 2 ranked options, which are 2 (40) and 0 (105).\n\n4. **Probs:** Probabilities are assigned to reflect the confidence in each option, ensuring they sum to 1.  The highest probability is assigned to the correct answer (40), with the next highest to the plausible incorrect answer (105) and very low probabilities to other incorrect answers.\n",
