Here, `1` (452) and `3` (109) are the most plausible given the calculation. I incorrectly included 109 as it's the close number and not the correct calculation.\n\n*   **ranked:**  Contains the indices of all options, ranked in descending order of likelihood, according to the analysis. The most likely answer is at index 1 (452), followed by 3 (109), then 2 and finally 0.\n\n*   **probs:**  Represents the probability (confidence) associated with each option. The sum of all probabilities must be 1.  The probabilities are assigned based on how plausible each option is, based on the problem and calculation.  `probs[1]` is the highest as '452' is the correct answer.  `probs[3]` is next as it is the result of an incorrect calculation. 0 and 2 are given lower probability as there's no direct relation.\n",
