Burying is the most direct and necessary step for lithification.  While heating isn't directly *after* deposition, burial leads to increased pressure and temperature, so it's plausible.\n*   **ranked**:  This array orders the options by confidence.\n    *   **1 (burying)**: Most confident.  Sediment needs to be buried under layers of subsequent sediment to be compressed.\n    *   **0 (heating)**: Relatively confident. Burying leads to pressure increase and then some moderate heating from geothermal gradients.\n    *   **3 (weathering)**: Least likely in this sequence. Weathering happens *before* sediment deposition, to produce the sediment.\n    *   **2 (eroding)**: Erosion also typically happens *before* deposition, removing material from somewhere else that will become sediment.\n*   **probs**: These are probabilities assigned to each option, reflecting the ranking and ensuring they sum to 1.\n    *   Burying (1): 45%\n    *   Heating (0): 35%\n    *   Weathering (3): 10%\n    *   Eroding (2): 10%\n",
