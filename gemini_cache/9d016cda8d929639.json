Probability assigned: 0.6\n   * **'120' (idx=2):** This is a somewhat plausible error. It likely arises from misinterpreting the steps. Probability assigned: 0.3\n   * **'109' (idx=1):** This number is less likely to appear based on simple calculation errors. Probability assigned: 0.05\n   * **'5' (idx=3):** This is a very small number relative to the other numbers and the problem description, hence lowest confidence. Probability assigned: 0.05\n\n3. **Selected:**\n   * The `selected` array contains the indices of the top 2 most probable answers.  In this case, 0 (for '45') and 2 (for '120').\n\n4. **Ranked:**\n   * The `ranked` array lists all the indices in order of decreasing confidence, i.e., from most likely to least likely.\n\n5. **Probs:**\n   * The `probs` array contains the probability estimates for each option, ensuring they sum to 1.\n",
