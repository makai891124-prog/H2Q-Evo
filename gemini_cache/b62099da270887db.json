The specific values in `probs` can be adjusted based on the reasoning used. The key is the relative ranking and the sum being 1.\n* **Problem Solving Ability of the Model:**  This model isn't actually *solving* the problem in the mathematical sense. It's using a combination of pattern recognition, keyword association (e.g., \"age\", \"years\"), and a bit of common sense to estimate the likelihood of each answer being correct. A truly robust system would need a proper mathematical solver.\n",
