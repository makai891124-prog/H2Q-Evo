Solving this, we get `J = 10`. Therefore, in 3 years, Jerry will be 13.\n\n2.  **`selected`:**  The two most likely answers are selected based on the calculated solution and common sense. The answer is 13. '5' might be chosen as second option due to the problem mentioning '5 years ago'.\n\n3.  **`ranked`:** The options are ranked in order of likelihood:\n    *   `13` (Highest confidence: This is the correct solution to the word problem)\n    *   `5`  (Second highest confidence: problem mentions '5 years ago' so a student might mistakenly assume the answer is 5.)\n    *   `105` (Low Confidence: Could be a random guess or miscalculation, but less likely than \"5\")\n    *   `5600` (Lowest Confidence: Very unlikely to be the correct answer)\n\n4.  **`probs`:**  Probabilities are assigned to each option to reflect the confidence levels.  These probabilities *must* add up to 1.  The distribution reflects the ranking:\n    *   `13`: Assigned a high probability (0.6) since it's the correct answer.\n    *   `5`: Assigned a moderate probability (0.3) due to the problem context.\n    *   `105`: Assigned a low probability (0.05).\n    *   `5600`: Assigned a very low probability (0.05).\n\n**Important Considerations for a Real-World Implementation:**\n\n*   **Model Confidence:**  In a real application, the probabilities would be generated by a machine learning model or some other scoring mechanism. The accuracy of the probabilities directly impacts the usefulness of the ranked list.\n*   **Explainability:**  It's helpful to provide *explanations* for why each answer was ranked the way it was.  This can build user trust and help them learn from the system.\n*   **Thresholding:**  You might want to introduce a threshold for `selected`.  If no answer exceeds a certain probability, you might choose to return an empty `selected` list or indicate \"no confident answer.\"\n*   **Error Handling:**  The code should handle cases where the input is malformed or unexpected.\n*   **Numerical Precision:** If the calculation is more complex, ensure that numerical precision issues do not affect the ranking.\n",
