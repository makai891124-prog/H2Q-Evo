  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"selected\": [1, 3],\n  \"ranked\": [1, 3, 0, 2],\n  \"probs\": [0.05, 0.45, 0.02, 0.48]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation and Reasoning:**\n\nLet's break down why the above JSON is the response.  We need to estimate probabilities and rank options based on the problem's context.\n\n* **Let's define the variables:**\n    *  W = Wendy's current age\n    *  C = Colin's current age\n\n* **Translate the sentences into equations:**\n    *  \"Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.\":  W = 5 * (C + 7)\n    *  \"In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.\": C + 25 = (1/3) * W\n\n* **Solve the system of equations:**\n    1.  Substitute the first equation into the second: C + 25 = (1/3) * 5 * (C + 7)\n    2.  Multiply both sides by 3: 3C + 75 = 5C + 35\n    3.  Rearrange: 2C = 40\n    4.  Solve for C: C = 20\n\n* **Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.**\n\n* **Justification for probabilities and ranking:**\n\n    * **Option 3 ('20'):** This is the correct answer.  It should have the highest probability.\n    * **Option 1 ('5'):**  This is likely a distracter number.  Colin's age cannot be 5.\n    * **Option 0 ('105'):** Substituting C = 105 into C + 25 = (1/3) * W results in W = 390, and then using W = 5(C + 7), it results in W = 5(105 + 7) = 560. It is inconsistent, so the possibility should be lowest.\n    * **Option 2 ('5600'):** This number doesn't align with the order of magnitude that the problem suggest. It's a huge number that is unlikely to be related.\n\n* **JSON Breakdown:**\n\n    * `\"selected\": [1, 3]` : The selected option indexes are 1(5) and 3(20). Selected are the top 2 most probable.\n    * `\"ranked\": [1, 3, 0, 2]` :  The options are ranked based on the probability estimates in descending order, so, 5, 20, 105, 5600.\n    * `\"probs\": [0.05, 0.45, 0.02, 0.48]` : Estimated probabilities for each option, summing to 1. Option 3 (20) has the highest probability, reflecting that it is the correct answer.  Option 1 (5) is considered the second likely distracter. 0(105) and 2(5600) have lower probabilities.\n\nThis JSON response fulfills all the requirements of the prompt, providing both ranked options and probability estimates in the requested format.\n",
