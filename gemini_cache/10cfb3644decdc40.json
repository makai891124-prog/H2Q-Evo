The order is an educated guess as the question requires an assessment of the likelihood of different answers.\n*   `probs`: Assigns a probability to each option such that they sum to 1. This represents the confidence in each option being correct, with the correct answer (\"1920\") having the highest probability. The correct answer is 0.7, while the other incorrect answers is 0.05, 0.1, 0.15 respectively.\n",
