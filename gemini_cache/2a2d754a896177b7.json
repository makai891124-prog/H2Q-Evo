So each weekend they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.  Over 4 weeks, they watch 6 * 4 = 24 movies. The key is understanding that they watch 6 movies per weekend, and then multiply by the number of weeks. However, the most common mistake is to forget calculating the movies watched each Sunday, leading to a mistaken answer of 16 movies per weekend. Thus, a larger number than 24 is also possible with some mistake, resulting in 120 = 4 movies * 5 days * 6 weeks.\n\n*   **Ranking (ranked):**\n    *   `1 (120)`:  This represents the result of misunderstanding the question and making errors in logic. It is not logically correct in answering the question, and thus can only result from error.\n    *   `2 (24)`: This is the correct answer.\n    *   `3 (109)`: This value is unlikely as there is no way to reach this number.\n    *   `0 (5)`: This number does not relate to any calculations and is incorrect.\n\n*   **Selection (selected):** The top 2 ranked options (120 and 24) are selected.\n\n*   **Probabilities (probs):**\n    *   These are subjective probabilities reflecting the likelihood of someone choosing each answer.\n    *   `120` (index 1) has the highest probability as its the correct answer.\n    *   `24` (index 2) gets the second highest probability.\n    *   `5` and `109` get very low probabilities since they're highly unlikely answers.\n    *   The probabilities sum to 1.\n",
