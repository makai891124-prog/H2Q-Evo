This means he needs 100+50 = $150 from selling cards.  He keeps 1/3 of his original collection. Let 'x' be the original number of cards. He sells (2/3)x cards. So, (2/3)x * $1.5 = $150.  This simplifies to x = 150.\n\n* **\"selected\": [\"150\", \"105\"]** I have selected the top two most likely answers based on the prompt's constraints.\n* **\"ranked\": [\"150\", \"105\", \"5600\", \"5\"]**\n    * \"150\" is the most likely answer as derived in the problem analysis.\n    * \"105\" is the next most likely.  It's closer to 150 than the other options.\n    * \"5600\" and \"5\" are highly improbable as they lead to illogical scenarios within the problem's context.\n* **\"probs\": [0.3, 0.35, 0.25, 0.1]**\n    * These are probabilities reflecting the confidence level for each answer, summing to 1. The highest probability is assigned to the most likely answer (\"150\"), followed by \"105\", and then the significantly less likely \"5600\" and \"5\".  The probabilites were chosen to emphasize the higher confidence in \"150\" while still providing a reasonable (though lower) probability for \"105\".\n",
