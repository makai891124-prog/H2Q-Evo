Assign the highest probability (0.45) and rank it first.\n   * **Option 0 ('105'):** Incorrect. But might be guessed by miscalculating or misunderstanding the problem, so assign a lower probability but higher than random (0.25) and rank it second. Likely results from subtracting Grace's weight from Alex's weight by accident instead of adding them.\n   * **Option 3 ('5'):**  Incorrect. Might result from attempting to find an average or randomly guessing a small number. Assign a very low probability (0.05) and rank it fourth.\n   * **Option 2 ('5600'):** Incorrect. This is an unreasonably large number.  Assign a low probability (0.25), similar to option 0, but also influenced by Grace's weight * number to find Alex's weight, so the ranking is fourth.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Probabilities are estimates:**  The `probs` values are subjective and represent a reasonable guess based on common errors in math problems of this type.  A more sophisticated model could be trained to estimate these probabilities from real user data.\n* **Top Two Selection:** The `selected` field contains the indices of the two most likely answers based on the calculated probabilities. In this case, '623' and '105'.\n* **JSON Format:** The output strictly adheres to the specified JSON format, with `selected`, `ranked`, and `probs` as keys and their corresponding lists as values.\n",
