These probabilities should sum to 1.\n\n* Option 1 (623) gets the highest probability because it's the correct answer.\n* Option 0 (105)  is assigned a moderate probability reflecting that it might be a result of some miscalculation (e.g., subtracting instead of multiplying).\n* Options 3 (5) and 2 (5600) are nonsensical in the context of the problem, so they receive very low probabilities.\n",
