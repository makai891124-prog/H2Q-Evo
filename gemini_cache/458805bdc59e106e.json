These are index 2 (\"scars on its leg\") and index 0 (\"colors of its fur\").\n*   **ranked:** This array represents the options ranked from most likely to least likely to be something a lion *wouldn't* pass on.\n    *   Index 2 (scars): Acquired scars are not genetic and cannot be inherited. This is the strongest answer.\n    *   Index 0 (fur color): While fur color has a genetic basis, environmental factors and genetic mutations can influence it.\n    *   Index 3 (body size): Body size is heavily influenced by genetics.\n    *   Index 1 (tail length): Tail length is also heavily genetic.\n*   **probs:** This array represents the probabilities assigned to each option, summing to 1. The probabilities reflect the confidence in the ranking.  `probs[i]` corresponds to the probability of the option at `options[i]` being the correct answer.\n    *   Scars (index 2) gets the highest probability (0.45).\n    *   Fur color (index 0) gets the second-highest (0.28).\n    *   Body size (index 3) gets a lower probability (0.2).\n    *   Tail length (index 1) gets the lowest probability (0.07).\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe key to this question is understanding which characteristics are primarily genetic and which are acquired.  Scars are acquired during the lion's lifetime due to injuries and are not encoded in its DNA.  Fur color, body size, and tail length are all significantly influenced by genetics, although environment can play a role, particularly with fur color and body size.\n",
