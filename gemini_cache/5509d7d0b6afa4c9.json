In a week, he eats 9 * 7 = 63 pretzels.\n\n2. **Ranking and Selection:**\n   - \"2\" (63) is ranked first because it's the correct answer.\n   - \"0\" (105) is ranked second because it represents multiplying 18 by 6 (maybe confusing with 7 days -1 for a day) - a somewhat plausible miscalculation.\n   - \"1\" (5600) is ranked third because there's no logical arithmetic process to get this result directly from the question.\n   - \"3\" (5) is ranked last as it's entirely disconnected to the values in the question.\n   - The `selected` array contains the indices of the top 2 ranked options: \"2\" and \"0\".\n\n3. **Probabilities:**\n   - The `probs` array reflects the confidence in each option, summing to 1.  The correct answer (\"2\") has the highest probability (0.4), followed by \"0\" at 0.35, then \"1\" (0.1), and finally \"3\" (0.15).  The values are chosen to reflect the relative plausibility and common mistakes a user might make. These values would be ideally derived from model calibration data.\n",
