Therefore $36(3) and by extension $5(1) are potentially answers.\n* **`selected`:**  We choose the top 2 most likely answers (indices 1 and 3, corresponding to \"5\" and \"36\").  This is based on the assumption that the user would reasonably come up with 5, if for example they incorrectly only focused on either the pencil or the eraser costs.\n* **`ranked`:** The options are ranked in order of decreasing probability. \"5\" has highest confidence, followed by \"36\", then \"105\", then \"5600\".\n* **`probs`:** Probabilities are assigned based on the likelihood of each answer being correct. \"5\" receives the highest probability as it is the one most likely to be mistaken for being correct. \"36\" is the actual answer so it is assigned a moderately high probability.  The other options receive significantly lower probabilities as they're less likely to be chosen, and \"5600\" has the lowest probability as it's nonsensical in the context of the problem. The probabilities sum to 1.\n",
