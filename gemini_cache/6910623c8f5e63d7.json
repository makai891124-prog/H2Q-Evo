Index 3 corresponds to the correct answer (6 * $2 + 8 * $3 = $12 + $24 = $36).\n\n* **`ranked`: [3, 0, 1, 2]`**:  This is the ranked list of all the options, from most likely to least likely. It puts index 3, representing the correct answer \"36\", first. \"105\" is ranked second, and the other options come last.\n\n* **`probs`: [0.45, 0.05, 0.02, 0.48]`**: This represents the probabilities associated with each option.\n    * The highest probability (0.48) is assigned to the correct answer \"36\" (index 3).\n    * \"105\"(index 0) gets a high probability too.\n    * The other options receive very low probabilities (0.05, 0.02).  The probabilities sum to 1.0.\n\n**Reasoning for the Probabilities:**\n\nThe probabilities reflect the following assumptions:\n\n* **Option 3 (\"36\") is the most likely.**  This is the correct answer, and the model assigns it the highest probability.\n* **Option 0 (\"105\") is somewhat likely.** This implies that the student probably miscalculated or misinterpreted the question, leading to a wrong conclusion.\n* **Options 1 (\"5\") and 2 (\"5600\") are very unlikely.** These numbers don't appear to relate to a reasonable calculation based on the problem statement.\n\nThis JSON format provides a clear and structured representation of the model's confidence in each option and the ranking of the options. The selection of the top 2 answers also provides insight into potential misconceptions or calculation errors a student might make.\n",
