Joseph spent $500 in May. In June, he spent $500 - $60 = $440.  Therefore, the total is $500 + $440 = $940. The second most plausible answer would be to subtract only $60 from $500, yielding a number like 105, thus indexing 3 and 0 are selected\n*   **ranked:** Based on reasoning, $940 (index 3) is the correct and most likely answer, followed by a simple miscalculation (index 0). The other options are extremely unlikely and therefore ranked lower.\n*   **probs:**  The probability distribution reflects the likelihood of each answer.  $940 has a high probability (0.80) of being correct, and 105 has lower possibility(0.15). The very incorrect options have very low probabilities. The sum of all probabilities equals 1.\n",
