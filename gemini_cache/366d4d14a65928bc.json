Selecting '940' directly addresses the problem's solution. The second most plausible selection is '105' could come from misunderstanding or incorrect subtraction.\n\n*   **`ranked`:** The options are ranked based on plausibility, with the correct answer '940' first, followed by '105', '5600' (likely arrived at due to an arithmetic mistake) and finally '5' (unlikely).\n\n*   **`probs`:**  The probabilities reflect the ranking and estimated likelihood of each option being chosen.  '940' has the highest probability (0.75), indicating a high degree of confidence. '105' receives a small probability (0.15), followed by '5600' and '5', which each receive 0.05. The probabilities sum to 1.\n",
