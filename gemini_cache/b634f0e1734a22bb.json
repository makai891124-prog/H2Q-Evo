Water content is (2/3) * 9 = 6 liters.\n   * Pineapple drink: 15 liters. Water content is (3/5) * 15 = 9 liters.\n   * Total drink: 9 liters + 15 liters = 24 liters.\n   * Total water: 6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters.\n\n2. **Option Ranking:**\n   * \"15\":  Correct answer (15 liters of water).  Highest confidence.\n   * \"109\": Not the correct answer, but possible if doing intermediate calculation incorrectly.\n   * \"5\": Far from the correct answer\n   * \"120\": Far from the correct answer\n3. **JSON Format:**\n   * `\"selected\"`: Contains the top 2 most probable answers based on the ranking (\"15\" and \"109\").\n   * `\"ranked\"`: Contains all options, sorted from highest to lowest probability (\"15\", \"109\", \"5\", and \"120\").\n   * `\"probs\"`: An array of probabilities, corresponding to the options in the order they appear in the original problem. The probabilities sum up to 1.  The probability assigned to \"15\" is the highest, \"109\" is second, while \"5\" and \"120\" get a low probability.\n",
