We know there are 25 total, 1 bad, 20% unripe (25 * 0.2 = 5), and 2 sour. Therefore, good oranges = 25 - 1 - 5 - 2 = 17.\n\n* **`selected`:**  The two most likely correct answers are '17' (index 0) and '5'(index 3 - represents unripe oranges).\n\n* **`ranked`:** This is an ordered list of option indices, from most probable to least probable.\n    * `0` ('17') is ranked highest because it is the correct answer.\n    * `3` ('5') is the second highest due to being directly related to the unripe calculation.\n    * `1` and `2` ('105' and '5600') are ranked very low as they are obviously incorrect, and there is no mathematical link with the context.\n\n* **`probs`:** Probabilities assigned to each option:\n    * Option '17' (index 0) has a high probability (0.98).\n    * Option '5' (index 3) has a much lower but still present probability (0.018).\n    * Option '105' (index 1) has a low probability.\n    * Option '5600' (index 2) has a low probability.\n    * The probabilities sum to 1.\n",
