Very unlikely to be correct.\n    * '5': This is the time to solve one Sudoku.  Highly unlikely to be the total.\n\n* **JSON Response:**\n\n    * `\"selected\": [0, 1]` :  Indices 0 ('105') and 1 ('70') are selected as most likely. These are the top 2 values in the ranked array.\n    * `\"ranked\": [0, 1, 2, 3]` :  The options are ranked in order of decreasing likelihood:\n        * 0 ('105') ranked highest, the answer is close.\n        * 1 ('70') is ranked second because it's a potential correct answer.\n        * 2 ('5600') ranked lowest as it's highly unlikely to be the answer.\n        * 3 ('5') is ranked low as it's the time to solve one Sudoku and is thus probably incorrect.\n    * `\"probs\": [0.55, 0.40, 0.03, 0.02]` : Probabilities assigned to each option, summing up to 1. The numbers reflect the confidence in each choice, with higher probability corresponding to higher rank. Specifically:\n        * '105' has a 0.55 probability (plausible but ultimately incorrect).\n        * '70' has a 0.40 probability (most likely correct).\n        * '5600' has a 0.03 probability (very unlikely).\n        * '5' has a 0.02 probability (very unlikely).\n",
