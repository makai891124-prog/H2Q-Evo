The six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs thrice that amount, meaning it costs 3 * $40 = $120. Therefore, the total cost of lunch is $40 + $120 = $160.\n\n2.  **Ranking:**\n    *   \"$160\" is the correct answer, so it's ranked highest.\n    *   \"$105\" is incorrect but a possible, nearby estimation. $40 + 2.5 * $20.\n    *   \"$5600\" and \"$5\" are completely unrelated to the problem.\n\n3.  **Selected:** The top two ranked options are selected: \"$160\" and \"$105\".\n\n4.  **Probabilities:** I've assigned probabilities based on the plausibility of each answer, reflecting the ranking.  The probabilities sum to 1.\n    *   \"160\" (Correct Answer): 0.45 (Highest probability)\n    *   \"105\": 0.3 (High probability, as there may be some calculation errors.)\n    *   \"5600\": 0.15 (Low probability, likely a misunderstanding of the prompt)\n    *   \"5\": 0.1 (Lowest probability, nearly certain to be incorrect)\n",
