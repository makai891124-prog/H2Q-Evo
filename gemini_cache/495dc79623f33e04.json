Ignoring bus trips and considering just hotel cost (3 nights at $80) might mislead user select 240, thus ranking it low. And the only value close to the hotel or bus costs is 105 (very far), 5600 is completely random. Therefore:\n        *   Option 2 (296) - Highest confidence (correct answer).\n        *   Option 0 (105) - Calculating something incorrectly or making a rough estimate.\n        *   Option 1 (5600) - No reason to pick this.\n        *   Option 3 (5) - Completely unrelated number.\n\n3.  **Selected:**\n\n    *   The top 2 ranked options are selected: option 2 and option 0\n\n4.  **Probabilities:**\n\n    *   The probabilities reflect the confidence in the ranking. Since $296 is the correct answer, it receives the highest probability (0.55).  $105 could be a result of some calculation error, therefore it is assigned some probability.  The other options are assigned low probabilities (0.05). The probabilities add up to 1.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   This solution makes assumptions about the reasoning behind incorrect answers. The probabilities are subjective and reflect the likely thought process of someone solving the problem.\n*   Ideally, a more sophisticated model would analyze the wording of the problem and potential errors more deeply to generate more accurate probabilities.  However, given the limitations of a text-based response, this solution provides a reasonable approximation.\n",
