Amy has 20 more than Lily, meaning Amy has 50 + 20 = 70 friends.  Together they have 50 + 70 = 120 friends.\n\n*   **`selected`:** The two most likely answers are 120 (index 2) and the next most likely is 109(index 3), while incorrect, is the closest number to 120.\n\n*   **`ranked`:** The answers are ranked from highest confidence to lowest.  120 (index 2) is the correct answer and therefore has the highest confidence. 109(index 3) is the next most likely and so on.\n\n*   **`probs`:** This array represents the probability (or confidence level) assigned to each option. Since 120 is the only correct answer, it gets a high probability (0.97). the remainder is split among the other options. Note that these probabilities are estimates and should be adjusted based on the specific model or reasoning process used.",
