This means Erin's points *after* = Sara's points + 3 * Sara's points = 4 * Sara's points = 4 * 8 = 32\n   * Erin had 32 - 14 = 18 points *before*\n\n2. **Reasoning for Ranking and Probabilities:**\n\n   * **'18' (index 3):** This is the correct answer. Highest probability.\n   * **'5' (index 1):**  Someone might mistakenly calculate the difference between 8 and 3 * 8 (24), then subtracting 14. Still a plausible error, so second highest probability.\n   * **'105' (index 0) and '5600' (index 2):** These numbers have no logical connection to the problem, so very low probabilities.\n\n3. **JSON Structure:**\n\n   * `\"selected\": [3, 1]`  The top two most likely answers (indices based on the options list).\n   * `\"ranked\": [3, 1, 0, 2]` Answers ranked by likelihood, from most to least likely.\n   * `\"probs\": [0.05, 0.25, 0.05, 0.65]` Probability assigned to each answer option. Probabilities sum up to 1.  These values are subjective but should reflect the relative likelihood of each answer being correct based on common errors when solving the problem.\n",
