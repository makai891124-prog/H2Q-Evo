This is a key understanding to solve it properly.  If it said \"three times as many points\" then it would have been 3 * Sara's points.\n    * Therefore, after scoring 14 points, Erin has 4 * 8 = 32 points.\n    * Before scoring 14 points, Erin had 32 - 14 = 18 points.\n\n* **`selected`:**  The top 2 most likely answers are selected.  In this case, '18' (index 3) is highly probable, and the next most probable is '105'(index 0), though far less likely.\n* **`ranked`:**  This list ranks the options from most likely to least likely. '18' is the correct answer and is thus ranked first. '105' is a wild guess but has a higher probability than the other two. '5' and '5600' are unreasonable and have the lowest ranks.\n* **`probs`:**  This provides a probability score for each option, reflecting the confidence in each answer.  The probabilities sum to 1. A probability is assigned to each option such that higher ranking options have a higher probability value. The ordering ensures a descending arrangement based on likelihood, reflecting the problem's constraints.\n",
