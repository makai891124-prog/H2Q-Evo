A switch directly stops current flow. A battery can effectively stop current if it's disconnected.\n*   **ranked:** `[2, 1, 3, 0]` - The options are ranked by probability of being correct:\n    *   `2` (switch): The most likely answer, as a switch is designed to interrupt current.\n    *   `1` (battery): A battery disconnected from the circuit will stop the current.\n    *   `3` (bulb):  While a blown bulb *can* stop current, it's not the primary mechanism and is more of a consequence.\n    *   `0` (wire): A wire facilitates current flow, so it's the least likely answer.\n*   **probs:** `[0.05, 0.4, 0.5, 0.05]` - Probabilities assigned to each option. These numbers are subjective but reflect the relative likelihood of each choice being correct, summing to 1.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n*   A switch is the most direct and common way to stop current flow in a circuit.\n*   A disconnected battery effectively stops current flow in a circuit.\n*   A blown bulb *can* stop current, but it's not the typical or intended method.\n*   A wire facilitates current flow, making it the least likely answer.\n",
