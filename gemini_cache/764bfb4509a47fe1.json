Quaternions\\n\\nQuaternions are a number system that extends complex numbers. They are particularly useful for representing rotations in 3D space without encountering gimbal lock issues. H2Q uses quaternions extensively for representing object orientations and transformations.\\n\\n*   **Definition:** A quaternion is a number of the form q = a + bi + cj + dk, where a, b, c, and d are real numbers, and i, j, and k are fundamental quaternion units.\\n*   **Usage:** In H2Q, quaternions are used to define rotations of geometric primitives. The `Quaternion` class provides methods for quaternion construction, normalization, multiplication (rotation composition), and conversion to rotation matrices.\\n\\n### 2. Fractal Geometry\\n\\nFractal geometry deals with shapes that exhibit self-similarity at different scales. Fractals are used in H2Q to generate complex and detailed geometric structures from simple iterative algorithms.\\n\\n*   **Definition:** Fractals are geometric shapes that exhibit self-similarity, meaning that parts of the shape resemble the whole shape at different scales.\\n*   **Usage:** H2Q incorporates fractal generation algorithms to create intricate geometric patterns. Modules are available for generating common fractals like the Mandelbrot set, Julia sets, and various L-systems.\\n\\n### 3. Knot Theory\\n\\nKnot theory studies mathematical knots. These are embeddings of a circle in 3D space. H2Q includes tools for creating and manipulating knots, which can be useful in various simulations and artistic applications.\\n\\n*   **Definition:** A knot is a closed curve embedded in 3D space, with crossings where the curve appears to intersect itself.\\n*   **Usage:** H2Q allows users to define knots using mathematical descriptions or polygonal approximations. Tools for knot manipulation include smoothing, simplification, and rendering.\\n\\n## Module Overview\\n\\n### 1.
