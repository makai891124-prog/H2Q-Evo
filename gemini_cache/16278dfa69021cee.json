Amy has 20 more than Lily, so Amy has 50 + 20 = 70 friends. Together, they have 50 + 70 = 120 friends.\n\n* **ranked:** The most likely answer is 120 (index 2), followed by 105(index 0).  The incorrect answers '5600' and '5' are ranked lower.\n\n* **selected:** The top two ranked options (highest confidence) are selected.\n\n* **probs:** These probabilities reflect the confidence in each answer.  '120' is the correct answer and has the highest probability (0.55). '105' is a possible mistake (e.g., adding 50+50+5), so it gets a lower probability (0.35). The vastly incorrect answers have even lower probabilities (0.05 each). The probabilities sum to 1.\n",
