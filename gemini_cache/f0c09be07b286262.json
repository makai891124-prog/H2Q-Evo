Here's the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n    *   Orange drink: 10 liters - 1 liter spilled = 9 liters remaining.\n    *   Water in orange drink: (2/3) * 9 = 6 liters.\n    *   Water in pineapple drink: (3/5) * 15 = 9 liters.\n    *   Total water: 6 + 9 = 15 liters.\n\n*   **Option 4 ('5'):** This could be a possible calculation step or misunderstanding. Maybe it is part of an calculation.\n\n*   **Option 0 ('105'):**  Very unlikely, no reasonable calculation would lead to 105.\n\n*   **Option 2 ('5600'):**  Extremely unlikely, the numbers involved don't suggest any operation that would result in such a large number.\n\nThe probabilities are assigned based on this likelihood, summing to 1. The `ranked` array reflects this confidence ordering from most to least likely. `selected` has the top 2 elements in `ranked`.",
