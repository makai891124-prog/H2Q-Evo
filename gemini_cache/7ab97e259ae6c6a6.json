The person is still moving downwards (positive velocity), but the parachute is slowing them down (negative acceleration).\n    * **0: Velocity and acceleration both remain positive.**  While the velocity *is* positive, the acceleration becomes negative as the parachute decelerates the person.\n    * **1: Velocity and acceleration both become negative.**  The velocity is still downwards, so it remains positive.\n    * **3: Velocity becomes negative but acceleration remains positive.** The velocity is downwards. A positive acceleration would further increase the downward velocity.\n* **probs:** The probabilities reflect the ranking and the likelihood of each answer being correct.\n    * 2 has the highest probability (0.55) because it's the most plausible explanation.\n    * 0 has a moderate probability (0.35) as part of it is correct.\n    * 1 and 3 have very low probabilities (0.05 each) as they contradict the basic understanding of the scenario.\n",
