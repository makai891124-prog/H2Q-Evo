It should have the highest probability.\n   * **5:**  This is close to the correct answer and might represent a partial calculation or a common mistake (e.g., forgetting one of the activities). Therefore, it should have the second highest probability.\n   * **105:** This is a large, incorrect number. It indicates a misunderstanding of the problem's scale.\n   * **5600:** This number is even more outlandish, implying a severe misinterpretation.\n\n3. **Probabilities:**\n   * We assign probabilities that reflect the ranking, ensuring they sum up to 1.  Higher ranks get significantly higher probabilities.\n\n4. **Selection:**\n   * The `selected` array contains the indices of the top 2 most likely answers based on the probabilities in `probs`. In this case index 2 (value '8') and index 3 (value '5').\n",
