So, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies each weekend. Over 4 weeks, that's 6 * 4 = 24 movies.  However, a closer inspection reveals that 4*4 = 16, 16/2=8. 16+8=24. It should be 6 * 4 = 24. If they watch 4 movies *per person* with 4+people, then that's wrong and needs clarification. In the absence of this, 24 is correct with 4 per person being 4*4=16 movies, then 16/2=8 movies, thus 16+8=24. However, in a different approach, this suggests that they watch 4 movies overall and half (2) of movies on sunday so 4 +2 = 6. The real answer is 4 +2 = 6 * 4 weeks = 24. This gives us 4*4 = 16, 16/2 =8. 16+8= 24 (so 24 total). If its per person, it should be clarified in the problem text.\n\n    The problem mentions watching 4 movies every Saturday. Jill and her friends is more than one person but we can't assume its per person without clarification.\n\n*  Option '105': 24 x 4 weeks is close to 100, which suggest that they only watch for a single Saturday and Sunday out of the four weeks and the 4 + .25 which ends up adding up to 6 and adding on the other 100. We would then choose option 0 (105) as the second option.\n\n* **ranked:**\n    * **0 ('105'):** High confidence after calculating weekly movie watching (6), then 4 weeks 24, but something being added to suggest 105.\n    * **2 ('24'):**  High confidence as it's the directly calculated correct answer.\n    * **3 ('5'):** Low confidence because it is an incorrect answer. It only pertains to approximately single day calculations.\n    * **1 ('5600'):** Extremely low confidence; a very large, unreasonable number and completely irrelevant to the calculations.\n\n* **probs:** These are probabilities summing to 1. They reflect the confidence ranking.\n    * '105' gets the second highest, and it is a reasonable wrong answer based on understanding part of the prompt.\n    * '24' as our top answer.\n    * '5' (lower probability because it only takes the movie day (Sunday and Saturday).\n    * '5600' is by far the lowest probability; it's not related to the calculations at all.\n",
