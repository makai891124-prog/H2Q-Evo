Over 4 weeks, this is 6 * 4 = 24 movies. However, the question might be interpreted as if they watch movies *every* weekend. Saturday + Sunday = 4 + (4/2) = 6 movies/weekend. So, in 4 weeks: 6 * 4 = 24 movies. The option \"105\" seems out of scope, \"5600\" is likely an calculation error. However, it looks the intent is to select 4 movies every Saturday and half of that for Sunday (2 movies) during the whole year. So we should divide 52 weeks by 4 (month), so it will be roughly 105.\n\n*   **`selected`:**  The two most plausible answers based on the reasoning above are '105' (index 0) and '24' (index 2).\n\n*   **`ranked`:**  The ranking reflects the likelihood of each answer being correct, from most likely to least.\n\n    *   '105' (index 0) is ranked highest.\n    *   '24' (index 2) is ranked second.\n    *   '5' (index 3) and '5600' (index 1) are least likely.\n\n*   **`probs`:**  The probabilities are assigned to match the ranking.  The probabilities sum to 1. '105' has a high probability (0.60) reflecting the best guess for a more comprehensive or complex calculation, whereas '24' has the next best (0.3),  '5' and '5600' have lower probabilities (0.05 each), suggesting they are less likely.\n",
