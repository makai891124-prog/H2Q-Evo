Good oranges = 25 (total) - 1 (bad) - 0.20\\*25 (unripe) - 2 (sour) = 25 - 1 - 5 - 2 = 17. The next closest is if the unripe ones are included.\n\n*   **`ranked`**: The options are ranked by likelihood.  \"17\" is the most likely correct answer, then \"5\" (rounding error consideration that 20% might be 4.x and rounding down or some unstated rounding), then \"120\" and \"109\" are very unlikely based on any reasonable interpretation of the problem.\n\n*   **`probs`**:  This is a probability distribution over the options. The probabilities sum to 1.  The values are chosen to reflect the confidence in each answer.  Since \"17\" is the definite answer, it gets the highest probability. \"5\" is included because of the possible rounding errors of unripe, so a medium probability. The remaining are very unlikely and are assigned low probabilities. These values were manually adjusted to reflect plausibility.\n",
