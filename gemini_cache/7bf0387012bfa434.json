Since the correct answer is 90, index 3 is first. And 105 is relatively near the correct answer of 90, so index 0 is second.\n   - **`ranked`:**  Contains the indices of all options, ranked in descending order of probability (most likely to least likely).  The order is based on the reasoning below.\n   - **`probs`:** Contains the probability assigned to each option.  The probabilities sum to 1.\n\n3. **Reasoning for Probabilities and Ranking:**\n\n   * **Index 3 (90):** This is the correct answer. It receives the highest probability (0.93).\n   * **Index 0 (105):** This answer might be chosen if someone made a slight calculation error. It's close to the correct value, so it gets the second-highest probability (0.05).\n   * **Index 1 (5):** This is a very small number compared to the expected answer, suggesting a misunderstanding of the problem.  It receives a low probability (0.01).\n   * **Index 2 (5600):** This is a very large number, which is clearly not the correct answer given the starting amounts. It gets the lowest probability (0.01).\n\n4. **Ranking Justification:**\n    - **3 (90):** Most likely (correct answer).\n    - **0 (105):** Second most likely (close to the correct answer, potential calculation error).\n    - **1 (5):** More plausible than 5600, as it might arise from misinterpreting some numbers.\n    - **2 (5600):** Least likely (way off from the expected answer).\n",
