This is a well-documented phenomenon.\n\n*   **Option 0: 'In about a quarter of households with children, men stay home with the children so their wives can work.'**  This is less common but becoming more frequent. While not \"most,\" a significant and growing minority of families are structured this way.  Data suggests the actual number is lower than 25%, but it's a trend.\n\n*   **Option 1: 'Most women believe that there is equal opportunity today between men and women in career choice, advancement, and income.'** This is generally *not* consistent with research. Most research indicates that women perceive significant disparities in opportunity and pay.\n\n*   **Option 2: 'Most men believe that women should be homemakers because men earn more money.'** This statement reflects outdated attitudes and isn't supported by current research, although pockets of this belief system may still exist. General sentiment is much more egalitarian.\n\n**Ranking and Probabilities:**\n\n*   **Ranked:** The options are ranked based on how strongly they are supported by available evidence. Option 3 is most aligned with research, followed by option 0 and then option 1 and 2, that go againist general evidence.\n*   **Selected:** The top two options (3 and 0) are selected.\n*   **Probs:** Probabilities are assigned to reflect the confidence in the truthfulness of each statement, based on research findings, summing up to 1. Option 3 is assigned the highest probability due to strong supporting evidence. Option 0 has a moderate probability, and options 1 and 2 have lower probabilities because they are contradicted by evidence.",
