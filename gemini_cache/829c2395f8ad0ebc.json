The \"second shift\" phenomenon is widely observed.\n    *   Option 0 (\"In about a quarter of households with children, men stay home with the children so their wives can work.\") represents that while the number of stay-at-home fathers has been rising, this option can still be considered a correct answer.\n\n*   **`ranked`: [3, 0, 1, 2]`**\n    *   This shows the ranking of all options from most confident to least confident based on my understanding of the research domain. The ranking is in descending order of confidence.\n    *   The remaining ordering reflects the following:\n        *   Option 1 (\"Most women believe that there is equal opportunity today between men and women in career choice, advancement, and income.\") is generally considered false. Many women perceive inequalities.\n        *   Option 2 (\"Most men believe that women should be homemakers because men earn more money.\") is a stereotypical view that doesn't hold true for most men.\n\n*   **`probs`: [0.35, 0.15, 0.10, 0.40]`**\n    *   This provides probability scores representing the confidence level assigned to each option being correct.  These probabilities sum to 1.\n    *   A higher probability is assigned to option 3, reflecting a higher level of confidence that it aligns with established research.\n    *   Option 0 has a notable probability.\n    *   Options 1 and 2 have lower probabilities, indicating a lower likelihood of being accurate representations of current research findings.\n",
