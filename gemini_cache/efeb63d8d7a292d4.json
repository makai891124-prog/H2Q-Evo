It's the most likely selection.\n    *   `1`: Represents the option \"5,\" which could be the case of missing half operation after left(20).\n*   **ranked:**\n    *   `3`: \"10\" - Highest confidence as it's the correct answer.\n    *   `1`: \"5\" - second highest as it's a plausible error.\n    *   `0`: \"105\" - Unlikely, as it's significantly higher than the initial number of loaves.\n    *   `2`: \"5600\" - Extremely unlikely and nonsensical in the context of the problem.\n*   **probs:**\n    *   `0.55`: Probability assigned to \"10\" (the correct answer).  Highest probability.\n    *   `0.35`: Probability assigned to \"5\" (a plausible error).\n    *   `0.05`: Probability assigned to \"105\". Low because it is not related to the number.\n    *   `0.05`: Probability assigned to \"5600\". Lowest probability as it's a very unreasonable answer.\n\nThe probabilities sum to 1. The `selected` array contains the indices of the two options with the highest probabilities (most likely correct answers). The `ranked` array shows the order of options from highest to lowest confidence.\n",
