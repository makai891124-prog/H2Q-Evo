While not the *exact* answer to the specific question (\"how many in the afternoon?\"), it's closer than the other incorrect options and a common error point.  Therefore, high confidence.\n   * **Option 1: '5'** - The correct answer based on the problem analysis. High confidence, second highest.\n   * **Option 0: '105'** - No logical connection to the problem. Low confidence.\n   * **Option 2: '5600'** -  No logical connection to the problem and numerically far removed from reasonable values. Very low confidence.\n\n3. **JSON Output:**\n   * `\"selected\": [3, 1]` - The top 2 ranked options are selected, index are `3` (for `10`) and `1` (for `5`).\n   * `\"ranked\": [3, 1, 0, 2]` - The indices of the options are ordered by our confidence levels (highest to lowest).\n   * `\"probs\": [0.01, 0.39, 0.01, 0.59]` -  Probabilities assigned to each option, reflecting our confidence. These probabilities sum to 1.  I've assigned the highest probability to '10' and '5' and minuscule probabilities to the other two options which are irrelevant.  Note that the exact probabilities are subjective but should reflect the relative likelihood of each option being the correct answer.\n",
