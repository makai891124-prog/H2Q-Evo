Since this is the right solution, we will choose answer option `0` - `'109'`.\n\n2. **Reasoning for Probabilities & Ranking:**\n\n   * **\"120\" (idx=2):** This is the closest numerical answer to the correct answer (109) within the provided options, suggesting a possible calculation error or rounding. Therefore, it's assigned the highest probability (0.55).\n   * **\"109\" (idx=0):** This is the correct answer after solving the problem. Second highest probability to reflect that it is the correct answer, but \"120\" may be a \"close miss\". (0.35).\n   * **\"34\" (idx=1) and \"5\" (idx=3):** These values are significantly far from the calculated age. So, we can assign them very low probabilities (0.05 each).\n\n3. **Selected:**\n   * Since the question demands the selection of 2 options and the most plausible answers are 120 and 109 according to our reasoning, these options's indexes (2 and 0) will be present in the `selected` list.\n\n4. **Constraints:**\n   * The probabilities sum up to 1: 0.35 + 0.05 + 0.55 + 0.05 = 1.0\n   * `ranked` is in descending order of probabilities.\n   * `selected` contains the indexes of the top 2 ranked options.\n",
