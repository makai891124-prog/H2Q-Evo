Each sack contains 25 kilograms.  So, she gave away 7 * 25 = 175 kilograms.\n\n* **`selected`:**\n    * `1` corresponds to '175' (correct answer)\n    * `0` corresponds to '105' (incorrect, likely representing the rice given to either the cousin or brother, but not both combined) - still a somewhat plausible answer based on a misunderstanding.\n\n* **`ranked`:**\n    * `1` ('175') - Highest confidence as it's the correct answer.\n    * `0` ('105') - Second highest, representing a partial calculation.\n    * `2` ('5600') -  Much lower. It is likely 20 * 25 * (3+4) which has no meaning here.\n    * `3` ('5') - Lowest. It is even further away from plausible answers, the only number related to quantities of sacks given is 3 and 4.\n\n* **`probs`:**\n    * `0.4`: '175' (Correct answer, highest probability).\n    * `0.3`: '105' (Partial answer, second highest).\n    * `0.15`: '5600' (Incorrect answer, lower probability).\n    * `0.15`: '5' (Incorrect answer, lowest probability).\n    * The probabilities sum to 1.\n\n**Reasoning for Probabilities:**\n\nThe probabilities are assigned based on how likely a user might select that answer given the problem. The correct answer has the highest probability. An answer derived from a partial or incorrect calculation (like just considering one recipient) gets a lower, but still significant, probability. Wildly incorrect answers get the lowest probabilities. The specific values are chosen to reflect the relative likelihood of each answer being selected, given the problem's wording and potential for misunderstanding.\n",
