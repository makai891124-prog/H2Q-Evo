He earns $0.20 per package. He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, meaning 40 packages/hour.\n\n*   **Correct Calculation:**  Earnings per hour: 40 packages * $0.20/package = $8/hour.  Earnings in 8 hours: $8/hour * 8 hours = $64.\n\n*   **Ranking Justification:**\n    *   **'64' (idx=2):**  This is the correct answer. Highest confidence.\n    *   **'5' (idx=3):** Plausible if only considered one hour.\n    *   **'105' (idx=0) , '5600'(idx=1):**  These are implausible, reflecting misinterpretations or arithmetic errors. Lowest confidence.\n\n*   **Probabilities:**  The `probs` array reflects the confidence levels assigned to each option. The values are normalized to sum to 1.\n    * '64':0.52 Highest\n    * '5':0.4\n    * '105':0.05\n    * '5600':0.03\n\n*   **Selected:** Top 2 probabilities \"64\", \"5\"\n",
