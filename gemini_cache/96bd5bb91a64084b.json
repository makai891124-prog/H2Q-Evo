He completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour. In an 8-hour workday, he earns 40 packages/hour * 8 hours * $0.20/package = $64.\n\n2. **Option Ranking & Selection:**\n   - **\"64\" (idx 2):** This is the correct answer based on the calculation above. (Highest confidence)\n   - **\"5\" (idx 3):** 50-10=40, 40*0.2=8, 但是问题问的是eight-hour workday, 因此这个答案有干扰性。(High Confidence, but less than the correct answer)\n   - **\"105\" (idx 0) and \"5600\" (idx 1):** These numbers don't seem directly related to a reasonable calculation of Colby's earnings based on the information given, so they are ranked lower. (Lowest Confidence)\n\n3. **JSON Format:**\n   - `\"selected\": [\"3\", \"2\"]`: The top two options (index 3, index 2) based on the above ranking are selected.\n   - `\"ranked\": [\"3\", \"2\", \"0\", \"1\"]`:  The options are ranked in descending order of confidence.\n   - `\"probs\": [0.05, 0.05, 0.45, 0.45]`:  Probability distribution summing to 1.  The correct answer \"64\" (index 2) and \"5\" (index 3) are given highest probabilities, while the incorrect options are given lower probabilities. The probability is subjective.\n",
