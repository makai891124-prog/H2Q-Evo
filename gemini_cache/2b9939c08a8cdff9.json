The higher oxidation state of nitrogen in nitric acid (HNO3) compared to nitrous acid (HNO2) leads to greater inductive electron withdrawal by the oxygen atoms.  This weakens the O-H bond and stabilizes the conjugate base (nitrate ion), making nitric acid a stronger acid. Hence, high probability.\n*   **Option 2 (the –O–H bonds in nitric acid are much weaker than in nitrous acid due to the electron withdrawing of more oxygen atoms on nitric acid):** This expands on option 1 by detailing the O-H bond weakening effect and is a significant factor. High probability.\n*   **Option 0 (the nitrogen in nitric acid is more electronegative than the nitrogen in nitrous acid):** While the *effective* electronegativity of nitrogen might be considered higher in nitric acid due to the attached oxygens, this statement is technically not as precise as saying that *more oxygen atoms* lead to greater electron withdrawal. The nitrogen atom itself doesn't intrinsically become more electronegative. Medium probability.\n*   **Option 3 (nitric acid has the hydrogen atoms bound directly to the nitrogen atom):** This is incorrect. In both nitric and nitrous acid, the hydrogen is bound to an oxygen atom (O-H). Low probability.\n\n**JSON Format:**\n\nThe JSON format adheres to the prompt's requirements:\n\n*   `selected`: Contains the indices (0-based) of the top 2 choices (1 and 2).\n*   `ranked`:  Lists all the indices in order of decreasing confidence (1, 2, 0, 3).\n*   `probs`: Provides a probability distribution across all the options, summing to 1 (0.1, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2).  These probabilities reflect the relative confidence in each option.\n",
