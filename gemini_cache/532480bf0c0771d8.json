It has the highest probability.\n   * **105 (Index 0):** A potential distracter if someone misinterprets the problem or makes a calculation error.  (e.g., if they thought it was 7 times less than sam, then 70 - 40 = 30, and 70 + 30=100, close to 105)\n   * **5600 (Index 2):** This is likely a distracter obtained by multiplying 70*7*40. Least likely.\n   * **5 (Index 1):** This number is very unlikely to be relevant given the numbers in the problem, given the correct understanding, so this would have the lowest probability.\n\n3. **Selected:**  We choose the top two most likely answers (450 and 105).\n\n4. **Probabilities Sum to 1:**  The probabilities are assigned to reflect the likelihood of each answer being correct, summing to 1. These are subjective and based on the problem's structure and common errors people might make.\n",
