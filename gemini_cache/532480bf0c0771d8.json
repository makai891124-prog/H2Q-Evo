The probabilities sum up to 1.  The correct answer (450) has the highest probability.\n    *   450 is given higher probability of 0.5 to represent it as the most confident answer.\n    *   105 is given 0.35 as it's a reasonable result when students got part of the formula right.\n    *   5600 is given 0.1 because this number is possible when multiplying 70*7.\n    *   5 is given only 0.05 since there's no obvious link.\n",
