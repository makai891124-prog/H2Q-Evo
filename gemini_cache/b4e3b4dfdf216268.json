The angel, representing morality and ideal standards, strongly aligns with the superego.  Giving half the money suggests the ego trying to balance desires (id) and morality (superego). We select the top 2 most probable indices.\n*   **ranked**: This array represents the order of the options from most likely to least likely, based on the explanation above.\n    *   `superego` (3) is the most likely.\n    *   `ego` (2) is second most likely.\n    *   `id` (1) is less likely.\n    *   `libido` (0) is least likely.\n*   **probs**: These are probabilities assigned to each option, reflecting the ranking. The probabilities sum to 1. The `superego` has the highest probability (0.55), reflecting the strong connection between the angel and morality. `ego` gets a lower probability (0.3) as it represents the mediation. `id` gets a very low probability (0.1), and `libido` gets the lowest (0.05) since they are unrelated.\n\n**Freudian Concepts:**\n\n*   **Id:** The primitive and instinctual part of the mind that contains sexual and aggressive drives and hidden memories.  It operates on the \"pleasure principle,\" demanding immediate gratification.\n*   **Ego:** The realistic part that mediates between the desires of the id and the superego.  It operates on the \"reality principle,\" satisfying the id's desires in ways that are socially acceptable.\n*   **Superego:** The moral conscience and ethical standards of the mind. It incorporates values and morals learned from parents and society.\n*   **Libido:**  The term used by Freud to describe the psychic energy of the life instinct. While connected to the id, it is not directly represented by the angel in this scenario.",
