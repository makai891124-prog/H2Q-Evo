The most likely is \"720\", followed by \"105\", then \"5600\", and lastly \"5\".  720 is correct (4 washes/month * $15/wash * 12 months = $720).\n*   **`probs`: [0.35, 0.05, 0.55, 0.05]`**: These are probabilities associated with each option.  They sum to 1. Option 2 has the highest probability (0.55), indicating the highest confidence in that answer. Option 0 has the second highest at 0.35. The other two options have a very low probability each, indicating they are much less likely to be the correct answers.",
