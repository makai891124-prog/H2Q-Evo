The calculation is as follows: Two girls got 2 * (1/6 * 24) = 8 liters. A boy got 6 liters.  Therefore, 24 - 8 - 6 = 10 liters are left. Given the limited options, the answer is closest to '10' and '5'.\n* **`ranked`:** The answers are ranked from most to least likely.  '10' is the most likely, followed by '5', then the unreasonable answers '105' and '5600'.\n* **`probs`:** The probabilities are assigned to reflect the ranking. '10' has the highest probability (0.495) and '5' has the second highest probability (0.49). The other options have negligible probabilities. The probabilities sum to 1.0.\n",
