Therefore option 3 '10' is the correct answer. \n        * Based on the above analysis, '5' is closest to the answer.\n\n* **JSON Format:**\n\n    *   `selected`: An array containing the indices (starting from 0) of the two most likely correct options based on probability ('10' and '5').\n    *   `ranked`: An array of indices representing the options ranked by probability in descending order.\n    *   `probs`: An array of probabilities associated with each option. These probabilities sum up to 1. The first element in `probs` correspond to the probability for options[0], the second for options[1], and so on.\n\n* **Probability Allocation:** The 'probs' are assigned to create the descending order of `ranked` and reflect the reasoning:\n\n    *   '10' (index 3) is given the highest probability (0.50) as it's the correct answer.\n    *   '5' (index 1) is the closest number to the answer so assigned a higher probability (0.49).\n    *   Other options ('105' and '5600') are assigned very low probabilities (0.01 and 0.00).\n",
