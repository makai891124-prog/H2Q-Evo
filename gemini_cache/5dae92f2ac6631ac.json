Let 'r' be the number of red balloons and 'y' be the number of yellow balloons. We know r = 20.  We also know that 2r + 3y = 58.  Substituting r = 20, we get 40 + 3y = 58, so 3y = 18, and y = 6.\n\n* **Ranked:**\n    * \"6\" is the correct answer, so it has the highest confidence.\n    * \"5\"  is close to the answer and might arise from an incorrect calculation or misinterpretation (e.g., getting 15 instead of 18 when subtracting from 58). So it is given a high probability as well.\n    * \"105\" and \"5600\" seem completely unrelated to the numbers given in the problem or any reasonable calculation path, making them the least likely.\n\n* **Selected:** The top two ranked options (\"6\" and \"5\") are selected.\n\n* **Probs:** The probabilities are assigned based on the ranking and a reasonable estimation of how likely someone might choose that answer.  The probabilities sum to 1.  I have given higher probabilities to the most likely answers.\n\n**Important Note:**  The \"probs\" are based on a subjective assessment of the likelihood of different answers, given the problem context.  There's no single \"correct\" distribution of probabilities without more information about the test-taker. A more sophisticated approach would involve actually solving the problem and reasoning about common errors.\n",
