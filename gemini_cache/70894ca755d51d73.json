  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"selected\": [\n    3,\n    0\n  ],\n  \"ranked\": [\n    3,\n    0,\n    1,\n    2\n  ],\n  \"probs\": [\n    0.3,\n    0.05,\n    0.05,\n    0.6\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **`selected`: [3, 0]`**:  The two most likely correct answers are \"50\" (index 3) and \"105\" (index 0). Kylie收集了20+5=25个贝壳在周一，那么她在周二收集了25*2=50个贝壳。选择50为第一选择。考虑到题目描述可能存在歧义（times more的理解），选择105也合理。\n*   **`ranked`: [3, 0, 1, 2]`**:  This lists the indices of all options from most likely to least likely.\n    *   \"50\" (index 3) is ranked highest as it's the direct calculation.\n    *   \"105\" (index 0) is ranked second as it could be a misinterpretation of \"2 times more\".\n    *   \"5\" (index 1) and \"5600\" (index 2) are highly unlikely and ranked last.\n*   **`probs`: [0.3, 0.05, 0.05, 0.6]`**:  This represents the probabilities assigned to each option, summing to 1.  The probabilities reflect the confidence in the ranking:\n\n    *   \"50\" (index 3) has the highest probability (0.6)\n    *   \"105\" (index 0) has the second highest probability (0.3)\n    *   The remaining options have much lower probabilities (0.05 each).\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Calculate Monday's shells:** Robert collects 20 shells, and Kylie collects 5 more than Robert, so Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.\n2.  **Calculate Tuesday's shells:** Kylie collects 2 *times more* shells than she did on Monday.  This is where the ambiguity might lie.  A direct interpretation of \"2 times\" is 25 * 2 = 50.  However, some may interpret \"2 times *more*\" as meaning an *additional* 2 times, hence 25 + (2*25) = 75, or if 2 times *the amount*, then 25 + 25*2 = 75.\n\nGiven these choices, it is safer to select 50 as the primary answer, and rank other answers lower depending on ambiguity.\n",
