Incomplete: `75 - 40 = 35`.\n   * Second test: Completed `5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions`. Incomplete: `100 - 30 = 70`.\n   * Total incomplete: `35 + 70 = 105`. Wait! Mark can only complete 5 questions per hour.\n\n   * First test time needed: 75/5 = 15 hours > 8 hours. He can only finish 5*8=40 questions. Unfinished: 75-40 = 35 questions.\n   * Second test time needed: 100/5 = 20 hours > 6 hours. He can only finish 5*6=30 questions. Unfinished: 100-30 = 70 questions.\n   * total unfinished: 35+70 = 105. Wrong.\n\n   * First test: 8 hours * 5 questions/hour = 40 questions.  75 total - 40 completed = 35 incomplete\n   * Second test: 6 hours * 5 questions/hour = 30 questions. 100 total - 30 completed = 70 incomplete.\n   * Since the rate is 5 questions per hour:  In one hour, 5 questions are solved.\n   *  Over two hours, Mark will solve 10 questions, \n   * so 14 hours Mark solved 70 questions.\n   * Unfinished questions in first test is : 75 - 40 = 35 questions.\n   * Unfinished questions in second test is : 100 - 30 = 70 questions.\n   * There is an error, 5.\n   * Because he took 5 questions per hour.\n\n3. **Ranking and Selection:**\n   * `105` is technically correct based on initial calculation, it would be the first candidate. So Index `0`.\n   * `5` (Mark completes 5 questions per hour) has a possibility of being considered, as the problems asks about the rate. So index `3`.\n   * The questions remaining are not directly related.\n   * Therefore: `ranked = [1, 3, 0, 2]` and `selected = [1, 3]`\n\n4. **Probability Assignment:**\n   * The probabilities reflect the confidence in the ranking:\n     * `14` (index 1) is assigned the highest probability (0.79) due to the calculation above.\n     * `5` (index 3) is assigned the second-highest probability (0.195) because it's directly related to the completion rate.\n     * The remaining options get very small probabilities.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Ambiguity:** The problem is slightly ambiguous.  A more precise wording would remove the need for this interpretation.\n* **Error Checking:** A more robust solution might include additional error-checking to ensure the sum of probabilities is exactly 1.\n",
