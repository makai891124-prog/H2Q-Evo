However, based on the given options, we need to rank them based on a logical \"guess\" given that only two options can be selected.\n\n*   **'12' (Index 1):** The most plausible and actually correct. High probability.\n*   **'109' (Index 3):** Considering that the actual answer is 12, a number greater than 12 with a low to middle order of magnitude isn't completely implausible. Middle probability.\n*   **'5' (Index 0):** Could be interpreted as a partial calculation using only apples and bananas. Low probability.\n*   **'120' (Index 2):** A large number unrelated to the calculation. Extremely low probability.\n\nThe `probs` are assigned based on this probability assessment, ensuring they sum up to 1.\n\nThe `selected` array contains the indices of the two most likely answers based on the reasoning above.\n",
