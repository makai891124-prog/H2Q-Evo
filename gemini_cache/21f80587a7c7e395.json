This might represent a misunderstanding of the problem, only using 5 hours.\n   *   **\"5600\":** Lowest probability. Completely unrelated to the problem's solution or a reasonable miscalculation.\n\n4.  **JSON Format:**\n    *   `selected`: Contains the top two choices (\"54\" and \"105\").\n    *   `ranked`:  Orders the options from most likely to least likely (\"54\", \"105\", \"5\", \"5600\").\n    *   `probs`: Provides probabilities that add up to 1, reflecting the confidence in each option. The correct answer has the highest probability.\n",
