'560' is the most confident (correct) answer, followed by '105', followed by '5600' and finally '5'.\n\n*   **`probs`:** This array holds the probability associated with each option. The sum of the probabilities is 1. Higher confidence in an option translates to a higher probability. The provided probabilities reflect that '560' is significantly more likely to be the correct answer.",
