Therefore, it has the highest confidence and is ranked first.\n   - **'105' (idx 0):** While not the directly calculated result, it's closer to the number of total possible people in the auditorium, which requires doing (72 * (4/3)). Therefor it's selected as the second option.\n   - **'5' (idx 1) and '5600' (idx 2):** These are entirely unrelated numbers and are very unlikely to be the answer. Therefore, they are ranked last.\n\n3. **Reasoning for `probs`:**\n   - **'36' (idx 3):** Given that this the result of the correct arithmetic, the probablity score is high.\n   - **'105' (idx 0):** Given that this somewhat represents a total possible value, the probability score is moderate.\n   - **'5' (idx 1) and '5600' (idx 2):** Since they are the least likely to be the answer given the problem's context, their probability scores are low.\n   - The `probs` array sums up to 1.0.  The probabilities reflect a subjective assessment of the likelihood of each answer being correct based on the problem.\n",
