Far too high.\n   * '5': Incorrect.\n   * '5600': Incorrect. An absurdly large number.\n   * '10': Correct. This is the calculated percentage.\n\n3. **JSON Response Generation:**\n\n   * **`selected`**:  We are asked to select the top two most probable options. '10' (index 3) is correct. '5' (index 1) is the next most likely option based on the magnitude of the error.\n   * **`ranked`**:  Orders the options by probability (confidence).  '10' is ranked highest, followed by '5', then '105', and finally '5600'.\n   * **`probs`**: Assigns probabilities to each option. These probabilities should sum to 1.  Here's the reasoning for the probability assignments:\n      * '10' (index 3): High probability, given that it's the correct answer. (0.3)\n      * '5' (index 1): Reasonable error (divide percentage by 2), making it second most likely. (0.60)\n      * The other two options are clearly wrong, and are assigned low probabilities (0.05)\n\n**Important Note on `probs`**: Assigning precise probabilities is difficult without a model. The above assignment is a reasonable subjective estimate based on the problem and answer analysis, where the most correct answer is the highest probability and it decreases from there. A more advanced approach would involve training a model on similar problems to learn how to assign these probabilities.\n",
