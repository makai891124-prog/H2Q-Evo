Option 3 (\"exists naturally in three states on Earth.\") is considered the most unique characteristic of water. Option 1 (\"can be changed from a liquid to a solid\") is also a general property, but less unique than existing in three states *naturally* on earth.\n*   **ranked**: The options are ranked in descending order of likelihood of being correct. I ranked \"exists naturally in three states on Earth\" first, followed by \"can be changed from a liquid to a solid\". Options 0 and 2 were ranked lowest due to being incorrect.\n*   **probs**:  Probabilities reflecting the relative likelihood of each option being correct.\n    *   Option 3 (exists in three states): Highest probability (0.65) as this is a very unique feature.\n    *   Option 1 (liquid to solid): Moderate probability (0.25) because it's a general property, but still related to water.\n    *   Option 0 (low specific heat): Low probability (0.05) because water actually has a high specific heat.\n    *   Option 2 (dissolves few substances): Low probability (0.05) because water is a good solvent, dissolving *many* substances (though not *all*).\n*   **Important Note:**  The probabilities are subjective and reflect the expert's best judgment. The specific values (0.65, 0.25, 0.05, 0.05) are examples and could be adjusted based on a more detailed analysis.  The key is that they sum to 1 and reflect the relative ranking.\n",
