So he uses 2 * 3 = 6 masks per day.  Over 2 days, he uses 6 * 2 = 12 masks.\n*   **`selected`**:  The correct answer is 12 (index 3). We are also including 105 as a distractor with high but lower probability than 12.\n*   **`ranked`**: The answers are ranked in order of confidence, with the most likely correct answer first (12), followed by 105, then the obviously incorrect answers.\n*   **`probs`**:  Probabilities are assigned based on the ranking, reflecting the likelihood of each option being correct. 12 has the highest probability (0.35), reflecting it's the correct answer. 105 has a secondary probability (0.55) as a distractor. The others have low probabilities as they are far from the actual answer. The sum of the probabilities equals 1.0.\n",
