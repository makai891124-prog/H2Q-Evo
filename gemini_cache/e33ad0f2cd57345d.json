Since the question asks for how many masks in 2 days, only 12 is correct.  Since we are asked to pick 2 from the options, the closest is 105.\n\n* **`ranked`:**\n    * `[3, 0, 1, 2]`  This array represents the options ranked from most likely to be correct to least likely. '12' (index 3) is the most likely answer. '105' is the next most possible answer. The remaining options ('5' and '5600') are highly improbable.\n\n* **`probs`:**\n    * `[0.99, 0.005, 0.002, 0.993]`  These are probabilities assigned to each option, reflecting the confidence in their correctness. The probabilities sum up to 1. The correct answer '12' (index 3) and the closest value '105'(index 0) both have higher probabilities reflecting the answer selection. '5' and '5600' are assigned very low probabilities.\n\n**Important Considerations for Probability Assignment:**\n\nIn a real-world scenario, assigning accurate probabilities is crucial.  Since this is a straightforward calculation, the probabilities should ideally be much more skewed towards the correct answer. For instance, if we are certain the answer is '12', then a probability distribution of `[0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.997]` would be more appropriate. However, the instructions explicitly requested only 2 items to be selected.\n",
