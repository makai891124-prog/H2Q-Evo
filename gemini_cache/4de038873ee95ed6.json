The correct answer '3,750' corresponds to index 1. '3,650' is similar, so also selected.\n* **`ranked`: [1, 0, 3, 2]`**:\n    * Index 1 (3,750) is ranked highest because it's the correct answer.\n    * Index 0 (3,650) is ranked second because it is close to the correct answer.\n    * Index 3 (4,750) and 2 (4,650) are ranked lowest as they are further from the correct answer.\n* **`probs`: [0.45, 0.50, 0.02, 0.03]`**:  This represents the confidence level for each answer.\n    * 0.50 for the correct answer (3,750).\n    * 0.45 for a plausible but slightly wrong answer.\n    * 0.02 and 0.03 for the less likely answers.\n    * The probabilities sum to 1.\n",
