'3,750' is the correct answer (highest confidence).  '3,650' is close.  '4,750' and '4,650' are further away and less likely.\n*   **probs**: `[0.49, 0.50, 0.005, 0.005]` assigns probabilities to each option.  '3,750' has a probability of 0.50, reflecting high confidence. '3,650' is assigned a probability of 0.49 as it is numerically close. The other two are assigned minimal values.  The probabilities sum to 1.\n\n",
