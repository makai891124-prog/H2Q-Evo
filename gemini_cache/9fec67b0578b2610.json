While carbohydrate loading itself can be helpful, the *classic* glycogen loading regime (depletion then massive carb intake) can have negative side effects. These are selected as the top 2.\n*   **`ranked`: [2, 0, 3, 1]`**:  The options are ranked from most likely incorrect to least likely incorrect:\n    *   **2 (The classic glycogen loading regime)**: Most likely detrimental. The classic regime involves a depletion phase that can impair performance.\n    *   **0 (Carbohydrate loading)**: While beneficial in general, the classic glycogen depletion phase is problematic, ranking it higher than other valid nutritional strategies\n    *   **3 (Exogenous carbohydrate ingestion during exercise)**:  Generally beneficial and improves performance by providing fuel. Ranked lower.\n    *   **1 (Tapering)**:  Tapering is a rest and recovery strategy, not specifically a nutritional strategy, but often used in conjunction with nutrition to optimize performance. Ranked lowest.\n*   **`probs`: [0.3, 0.05, 0.45, 0.2]`**:  These probabilities reflect the confidence in each answer's incorrectness:\n    *   **0 (Carbohydrate loading): 0.3**: High confidence of being incorrect, but not the worst option\n    *   **1 (Tapering): 0.05**: Least likely to be detrimental.\n    *   **2 (The classic glycogen loading regime): 0.45**:  Highest confidence of being detrimental due to the initial depletion phase.\n    *   **3 (Exogenous carbohydrate ingestion during exercise): 0.2**: Less likely to be detrimental, but there are some potential downfalls such as GI distress, ranked higher than tapering\n\n    The probabilities sum to 1.\n",
