Classic glycogen loading has potential drawbacks and side effects that may hamper performance, particularly gastrointestinal issues. Carbohydrate loading is usually beneficial, but if done incorrectly without tapering it will not be.\n* **`ranked`: [2, 0, 3, 1]`** This list represents the ranking of the options from *least* to *most* likely to improve performance during prolonged endurance exercise, based on my understanding.\n    * **2 ('The classic glycogen loading regime'):** This is often considered outdated and can have negative side effects.  Therefore, it's least likely to improve performance reliably.\n    * **0 ('Carbohydrate loading'):** Carbohydrate loading improves performance only if it is done correctly and combined with tapering exercise.\n    * **3 ('Exogenous carbohydrate ingestion during exercise'):**  Ingesting carbohydrates *during* exercise is a well-established strategy to improve performance by maintaining blood glucose levels and sparing muscle glycogen.\n    * **1 ('Tapering'):** Tapering is crucial for allowing the body to recover and supercompensate, leading to improved performance. It is not directly nutritional, but it impacts the effectiveness of nutritional strategies.\n\n* **`probs`: [0.3, 0.05, 0.4, 0.25]`** This list assigns probabilities, reflecting the confidence in the ranking.  Note the probabilities add up to 1.  Higher probabilities are assigned to options that are considered more clearly *not* performance enhancing or clearly performance enhancing.\n    *  0.4 to 'The classic glycogen loading regime': High confidence that this is *less* helpful.\n    * 0.05 to 'Tapering': Low confidence that this is *less* helpful, as it is crucial.\n    *  0.3 to 'Carbohydrate loading': Medium confidence.\n    *  0.25 to 'Exogenous carbohydrate ingestion during exercise': relatively less confident that it does not improve performance.\n",
