Highest confidence.\n   * **'5600' (2):**  Could be a miscalculation (e.g., 800 per day multiplied by 7 days).  Second highest confidence as it is of the right magnitude.\n   * **'105' (0):** Likely confusion with the 150 per day amount, but a factor of 7 calculation mistake.  Lower confidence.\n   * **'5' (1):**  No direct relevance to the calculation.  Lowest confidence.\n\n3. **JSON Output:**\n   * `\"selected\": [3, 2]`:  The top 2 most likely options based on the above analysis (indices are 3 and 2 corresponding to '1050' and '5600').\n   * `\"ranked\": [3, 2, 0, 1]`:  All options ranked by confidence, from highest to lowest (corresponding to '1050', '5600', '105', '5').\n   * `\"probs\": [0.05, 0.01, 0.49, 0.45]`: Probabilities assigned based on the ranked confidence.  Higher probabilities assigned to the more likely options ('1050' and '5600'), and the sum equals 1 (approximately).  Note that the exact probabilities are somewhat subjective and based on how strongly the model believes in each possibility.\n",
