Jewel processes 50 customers daily. We need to find the combined weekly customer processing for both.\n\n2. **Calculations:**\n   * Julie's daily output: 50 customers * 2 = 100 customers\n   * Combined daily output: 50 + 100 = 150 customers\n   * Combined weekly output: 150 customers/day * 7 days/week = 1050 customers\n\n3. **Rationale for Ranking:**\n\n   * **1050 (idx 3):**  This is the correct answer. Highest probability.\n   * **105 (idx 0):**  Likely a result of incorrectly dividing the total weekly output by 10, assuming weekly output is per day. Reasonably high probability as a common mistake.\n   * **5600 (idx 2):** Might be a result of misunderstanding the prompt or calculations that led to high total output. Still a plausible answer.\n   * **5 (idx 1):** A very small number which can be considered an outlier and gets lowest probability.\n\n4. **JSON Format:**\n\n   * `\"selected\"`: Contains the indices of the top 2 most likely answers (3 and 0).\n   * `\"ranked\"`: Contains the indices of all options, ordered from most likely to least likely (3, 0, 2, 1).\n   * `\"probs\"`:  A list of probabilities (estimated) assigned to each option, summing up to 1.  These probabilities reflect the confidence in each answer.\n",
