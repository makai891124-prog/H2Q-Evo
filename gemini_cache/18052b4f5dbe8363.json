Index 0 represents \"Motive development\" and Index 3 represents \"Product evaluation.\".\n\n*   **`ranked`: [0, 3, 1, 2]`**: This array represents the ranking of the options from most likely to least likely:\n    *   `0`: \"Motive development.\" - Most likely related to recognizing a gap between desired and actual state. This could represent an unmet need which drives motivation.\n    *   `3`: \"Product evaluation.\" - A consumer might evaluate a product based on how well it closes the gap between their desired and actual state.  While not the primary definition of the imbalance itself, it's a consequence of recognizing that imbalance.\n    *   `1`: \"An attitude.\" - An attitude *could* be related, but it's a much broader concept than the specific imbalance described.\n    *   `2`: \"A self-concept.\" - While self-concept can influence desired state, it's not the direct cause or definition of the imbalance itself.\n\n*   **`probs`: [0.6, 0.1, 0.05, 0.25]`**:  These are the probabilities assigned to each option, summing to 1. These probabilities reflect the confidence in each option being the correct answer, based on the ranking. \"Motive development\" has the highest probability.\n",
