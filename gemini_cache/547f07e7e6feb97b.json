Street 3: 10 + (10 * 2) = 10 + 20 = 30 children.  Then 30 - 5 = 25 is still incorrect\n   * Let's rethink: Street 1: 5. Street 2: 5 * (1 + 1) = 10. Street 3: 10 * (1 + 2) = 30. Then 30 - 5 = 25\n   * Even better: At Street 2, 5 children + 5 * 1 new children = 10. At Street 3, 10 children + 10 * 2 = 30. Original 5 left, 30 - 5 = 25\n   * Let's analyze this another way:\n   * Street 1: 5 children\n   * Street 2: each child is joined by ANOTHER child.  Total children = 5 + (5 * 1) = 10 children\n   * Street 3: each child is joined by ANOTHER 2 children. Total children = 10 + (10 * 2) = 10 + 20 = 30 children\n   * Original 5 leave: 30 - 5 = 25 children\n\n   *Alternative calculation:\n   * Street 1: 5 children\n   * Street 2: Number of children doubles: 5 * 2 = 10 children\n   * Street 3: Each child in the existing group is joined by two children. So it triples (existing + 2 new):  10 * 3 = 30 children\n   * The original 5 children leave: 30 - 5 = 25 children\n\n2. **Reasoning for Probabilities:**\n\n   * **'25' (Index 0):**  While our initial calculation leads to 25, it's possible this is a trick question, or there could be some misinterpretation that leads to another answer. Therefore, we do not give it the highest probability.\n   * **'105' (Index 1):**  This is a completely incorrect answer. It is more than the other available choices, so could be a red herring.\n   * **'5600' (Index 2):** This is an extremely unlikely answer.  This is orders of magnitude larger than what the question implies.\n   * **'5' (Index 3):**  The initial number of children is important. It's possible there's a misunderstanding of the problem, leading to someone choosing this.\n\n3. **JSON Structure:**\n\n   * `\"selected\"`: The top 2 most likely indices (in this case, indices `1`, `0`).\n   * `\"ranked\"`: All indices, ordered from most likely to least likely based on the probability analysis.\n   * `\"probs\"`: The probabilities assigned to each answer, ensuring they sum up to 1.  The highest probabilities are given to the most plausible incorrect answers.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*  This response reflects a subjective assessment of the probabilities given the lack of a definitive correct answer among the choices.  A perfect score might not be possible with these options.\n* The exact probabilities are somewhat arbitrary but represent the relative confidence in each answer's likelihood.\n",
