Highest confidence.\n   * **5 (idx=1):**  This might be arrived at if someone only calculates the number of yellow balloons released, or misunderstands a part of the problem.  Second highest confidence because some partial calculation is happening.\n   * **105 (idx=0):**  This number doesn't directly relate to any intermediate or final result based on straightforward calculations, indicating a more random guess, but it is a multiple of several of the original numbers and results.\n   * **5600 (idx=2):**  This is a very large number compared to the initial balloon counts and the expected answer, making it the least likely and thus assigned the lowest confidence.\n\n3. **Probabilities:**\n\n   * The probabilities sum to 1.\n   * The probabilities roughly reflect the ranking: the correct answer has the highest probability, and the least likely answer has the lowest.  The probability distribution isn't perfectly linear to indicate a degree of uncertainty but strongly favors the correct answer.\n\n4. **Selected:**\n   * We take the top 2, which in this case are 34 (index 3) and 5 (index 1).\n",
