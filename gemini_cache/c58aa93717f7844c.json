Scarlett's total spending is: $10 (aquarium) + 2 * $2.50 (rocks) + 3 * $2.00 (coral) + 20 * $0.50 (fish) + $2.00 (food) = $10 + $5 + $6 + $10 + $2 = $33.  The other possible answer, $5, refers specifically to the bags of rocks\n* **ranked:**  The ranking reflects the likelihood of each answer being correct, from highest to lowest. '33' is the correct answer, followed by '5', then the two incorrect answers.\n* **probs:** These are probabilities assigned to each option. The values are chosen such that their sum is 1 and they reflect the ranking of the options based on how likely they are to be correct. '33' has the highest probability (0.6), followed by '5' at 0.3. The other options have lower probabilities (0.05). These probability values are illustrative and can be adjusted.\n",
