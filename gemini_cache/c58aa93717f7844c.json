Since the question asks the total amount spent, we select these two.\n* **`ranked`**: The options are ranked based on likelihood.\n    * 33 is the most likely (correct answer).\n    * 5 could be arrived at if only calculating parts of the expense (e.g., just the coral and fish food).\n    * 105 and 5600 are very unlikely.\n* **`probs`**: Probabilities are assigned based on the ranking, ensuring they sum to 1. Higher probabilities are given to the more likely answers.\n\n**Breakdown of Calculation:**\n\n* Aquarium: $10.00\n* Rocks: 2 * $2.50 = $5.00\n* Coral: 3 * $2.00 = $6.00\n* Fish: 20 * $0.50 = $10.00\n* Fish Food: $2.00\n\nTotal: $10 + $5 + $6 + $10 + $2 = $33.00\n",
