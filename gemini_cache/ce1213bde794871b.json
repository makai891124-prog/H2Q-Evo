While '25' is the exact answer to the main question, there's a decent possibility of misinterpreting the question or making a calculation error, leading to an answer close to '5'.\n\n* **`ranked`:**\n    * 0 ('25'):  Most likely, as it's the directly calculated answer.\n    * 3 ('5'):  Relatively likely, as a plausible mistake could lead to a nearby value.\n    * 1 ('105'): Less likely as it is significantly higher than 25, suggesting a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem.\n    * 2 ('5600'): Extremely unlikely.  This suggests a major error in calculation or interpretation.\n\n* **`probs`:**  These probabilities reflect the ranking.  '25' has the highest probability (0.45), '5' is second (0.49) reflecting a reasonable chance of a minor error in reasoning or calculating, and the other two options have very low probabilities (0.05, 0.01).  The probabilities sum to 1.\n",
