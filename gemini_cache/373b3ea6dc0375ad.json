High confidence.\n   * **105 (idx: 0):**  Likely a result of incorrect calculation steps involving addition.  Medium Confidence.\n   * **5 (idx: 3):**  No logical connection to the problem. Low confidence.\n   * **5600 (idx: 2):** Completely unrelated number.  Very Low confidence.\n\n3. **JSON Structure:**\n\n   * `\"selected\"`: Contains the indices of the top two most probable answers (45 and 105).\n   * `\"ranked\"`:  Orders all the indices based on the decreasing order of confidence.\n   * `\"probs\"`:  Probabilities assigned to each of the answer choices.  These probabilities sum to 1.  The probabilities reflect the confidence ranking, with higher probabilities assigned to the more likely answers.\n",
