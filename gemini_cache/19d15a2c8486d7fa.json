The numbers are much bigger, and it is impossible for her remaining money to be bigger than her paycheck.\n    * **3 (5):**  Completely unrelated and nonsensical.\n\n* **selected:**  The top two most likely answers (based on `ranked`) are selected: 720 and 105.\n\n* **probs:**  Probability distribution.  These probabilities are estimates based on the correctness and how likely a person might arrive at the wrong answer:\n    * **0 (105):** I gave a small probability of 0.35 as I believe this is a plausible answer for someone who made a miscalculation or misunderstanding of the percentages.\n    * **1 (5600):** Given a low probability of 0.05 because the number is much bigger, and it is impossible for her remaining money to be bigger than her paycheck.\n    * **2 (720):** Assign the highest probability of 0.45 as it's the correct answer.\n    * **3 (5):** Assign a small probability of 0.15 since it's completely unrelated and nonsensical.\n\n* **Sum of probs:** 0.35 + 0.05 + 0.45 + 0.15 = 1.0\n",
