Index 2 corresponds to 'the money supply should be increased steadily' and index 1 corresponds to 'crowding out is not a problem'. These are the two options considered most consistent with a monetarist perspective.\n* **`ranked`: [2, 1, 0, 3]`**:  This array ranks the options from most likely to be a monetarist view to least likely.\n    * 2 (the money supply should be increased steadily) - Generally considered a core tenet of monetarism.\n    * 1 (crowding out is not a problem) - Monetarists tend to believe crowding out is less significant than Keynesians.\n    * 0 (monetary policy should be used to fine-tune the economy) - Monetarists generally oppose fine-tuning, favoring rules-based policy.\n    * 3 (the velocity of money is unstable) - Monetarists traditionally assume a relatively stable velocity of money.\n* **`probs`: [0.05, 0.35, 0.45, 0.15]`**:  This assigns probabilities (representing confidence) to each option.  The probabilities sum to 1.\n    * 0.05 - 'monetary policy should be used to fine-tune the economy' - Lowest probability as it directly contradicts monetarist views.\n    * 0.35 - 'crowding out is not a problem' - Higher probability, reflecting the monetarist view that crowding out is less of a concern.\n    * 0.45 - 'the money supply should be increased steadily' - Highest probability, representing the core monetarist principle.\n    * 0.15 - 'the velocity of money is unstable' - Low probability as monetarists traditionally assume a stable velocity.\n",
