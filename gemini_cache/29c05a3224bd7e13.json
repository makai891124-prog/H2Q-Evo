So, '5' is ranked highest (index 3), followed by '14' (index 1), and so on.\n   * **`probs`**:  Represents the probability distribution across all options, summing to 1.  The highest probability is assigned to the correct answer ('5'), and the second-highest probability is assigned to '14'. The remaining values are set to low values.  The specific probability values are illustrative and will depend on the model used.\n",
