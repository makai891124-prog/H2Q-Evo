High confidence.\n    *   '14': This is Trey's laps, somewhat related. Medium confidence.\n    *   '105', '5600':  These numbers seem unrelated to the direct calculation. Low confidence.\n\n3.  **JSON Generation:**\n\n    *   `selected`: Contains the indices of the two most likely correct answers.\n    *   `ranked`:  Ordered by likelihood of correctness (highest to lowest).\n    *   `probs`: Probabilities assigned to each option, summing to 1. The probability distribution reflects the above evaluation, with the correct answer (5) having high probability, followed by 14.\n",
