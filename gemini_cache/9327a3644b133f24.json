We need to calculate the price after each year, or use the compound interest formula. Let P be the initial price ($120), r be the annual increase rate (5% or 0.05), and n be the number of years (3). The price after n years is P(1 + r)^n = 120(1 + 0.05)^3 = 120(1.05)^3 = 120 * 1.157625 = 138.915. Rounding to the nearest integer gives $139.  $138 is nearest integer if you truncate the decimal. $105 is the nearest answer from other calculation error.\n\n*   **`selected`:** The most likely answers are 138 and 105.\n*   **`ranked`:** The list orders the options from most to least likely.\n*   **`probs`:** The probabilities reflect the relative likelihood of each option being correct, with the highest probability assigned to $138 and $105.\n",
