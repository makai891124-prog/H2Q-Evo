Rounded to the nearest integer, it is $139, closest to the option '138'.\n\n2. **Reasoning for Ranking:**\n\n   * **3 (138):** This is the closest to the correct answer, making it the most likely choice.  Therefore highest confidence.\n   * **0 (105):** Some might mistakenly calculate the price reduction (if it was a price reduction problem instead of increase). So it is a reasonable error and the second most probable answer.\n   * **2 (5600):** This value is significantly higher than the initial price, indicating a misunderstanding of the problem. Lower probability than other values.\n   * **1 (5):**  This is likely a completely random guess or misunderstanding of the problem.  Lowest probability.\n\n3. **Probabilities:**\n\n   * The probabilities are assigned based on the ranking and reflect the likelihood of each answer being chosen by someone solving the problem. The probabilities sum to 1. 70% probability is given to the correct answer, 28% to 105 because this is a plausible mistake, and other answers are highly unlikely.\n\n4. **Selected:**  The `selected` array contains the indices of the top 2 ranked answers, based on the problem's constraints.\n",
