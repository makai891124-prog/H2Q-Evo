Option 0 (\"arrive for the event, and absolutely love the final outcome of the sweet cakes.\") directly follows the scenario of bakers making a cake for an event.  Option 3 (\"are gathered in spontaneous events celebrating their accomplishments and their participation in the event.\") fits well as a celebration tied to the event mentioned.\n* **ranked:** This list ranks all options from most likely to least likely based on the problem description. I rated these by similarity to the description, assuming the highest score should belong to answers more closely related to the final state of the \"special event\".\n* **probs:** This is a probability distribution across all options, summing up to 1. These values represent a guess at how likely each option is, reflecting the ranking above.  Option 0 has the highest probability, followed by option 3. The sum of `probs` is 1.0.\n",
