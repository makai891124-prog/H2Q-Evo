This is usually in a separate area.\n    *   `0`: \"recommended serving size.\" - Common on nutrition labels.\n    *   `1`: \"calories per serving.\" - Very common and required on nutrition labels.\n\n*   **`probs`: [0.05, 0.1, 0.55, 0.3]`** These probabilities represent the estimated confidence that the corresponding option is *not* found on a nutrition label.  They sum to 1.\n    *   `0.05`: Low probability for \"recommended serving size.\"\n    *   `0.1`: Relatively low probability for \"calories per serving.\"\n    *   `0.55`: High probability for \"a suggested meal plan.\"\n    *   `0.3`: Moderate probability for \"a list of ingredients.\" - While present on packaging, it's distinct from the nutrition facts panel.",
