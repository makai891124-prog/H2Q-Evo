Over 2 days, he uses 6 * 2 = 12 masks. Therefore, the correct answer is '12'.\n\n*   **`selected`**: We select the two options with the highest probability.  '12' is the most probable (index 1), and '5' (index 0) is the next highest (likely a quick, incorrect calculation if the person stopped at a single day calculation).\n\n*   **`ranked`**: We rank the options based on our estimated confidence level in them being the correct answer, in descending order. '12' is ranked highest (index 1), followed by '5' (index 0). The options '109' (index 3) and '120' (index 2) are very unlikely and therefore ranked lower.\n\n*   **`probs`**: The probabilities are assigned to reflect this confidence.\n    *   '12' (index 1) gets a high probability (0.9).\n    *   '5' (index 0) gets a smaller probability (0.05), reflecting that it might be a possible error in calculation.\n    *   '109' (index 3) and '120' (index 2) receive very low probabilities (0.04 and 0.01 respectively), as they are unlikely given the problem's structure.  The probabilities sum to 1.0.\n",
