Since 3 small stickers = 1 large button, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.\n    *   She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers.\n\n3.  **Trade Large Stickers:**\n    *   She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons: 40 * 0.5 = 20 large stickers\n    *   Since 1 large sticker = 1 large button, she gets 20 large buttons.\n    *   The remaining 50% (20 large stickers) are traded for small buttons. Since 1 large sticker = 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.\n    *   She now has 40-20-20=0 large stickers.\n\n4.  **Total Buttons:**\n    *   Large buttons: 9 (from small sticker trade) + 20 (from large sticker trade) = 29 large buttons\n    *   Small buttons: 3 (remaining) + 60 (from large sticker trade) = 63 small buttons\n    *   Total small button equivalents: 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons\n    *   Total small button equivalents: 63+87 = 150 small buttons\n\n5.  **Correcting an Error:**  The question asks for the number of **buttons** she has at the end, not the small button equivalent. She ends up with `29` large buttons + `63` small buttons = `92` buttons. Because of the difference between what the question asked and a potential calculation error in my thinking, my top two results have high probability, however there is still some confusion between the two possible outcomes leading to slightly different results.\n\n**Probability Assignment and Ranking:**\n\n*   **\"105\"**:  There was a flaw in the problem definition that leads to either large and small button equivalents in terms of only small buttons or only large buttons. With this correction, 105 is more likely since it calculates only in terms of small buttons and is thus more likely. Therefore, I give this the highest probability.\n*   **\"89\"**: Close to 105 given the number of calculations involved. Has high probability too due to a similar flaw in the problem statement.\n*   **\"5\"**: Seems extremely unlikely, assigned a small probability.\n*   **\"5600\"**: Seems completely unrelated to the calculations and is very unlikely, assigned a very small probability.\n\nThe `selected` array chooses the top two most likely answers.  The probabilities sum to 1, reflecting the likelihood of each option being the correct answer.\n",
