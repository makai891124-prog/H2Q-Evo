She gets large buttons for these.  Since 3 small stickers = 1 large button, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.\n    * **Large Stickers:** She trades 50% of 40 large stickers = 20 large stickers for large buttons. Each large sticker gets her one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.  She trades the remaining 40 / 2 = 20 large stickers for *small* buttons. Each large sticker gets her 3 small buttons, so she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.\n\n* **Calculate Final Inventory:**\n    * **Large Buttons:** She gets 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons.\n    * **Small Buttons:**  She gets 60 small buttons.\n\n* **Total Buttons:** 29 (large) + 60 (small) = 89 buttons.\n\n* **Answer 105 Analysis:** Although the calculation above is accurate, there's potentially another valid reasoning if you interpret \"large button\" in the problem in multiple ways, or make some mistakes in the calculation which leads to 105. Such as assuming all stickers are traded for buttons. This answer is more plausible than option 5, 5600 and should be ranked as #2.\n\n* **Option 5 & 5600:**  These numbers seem completely out of range and highly unlikely given the problem context.\n\n* **Probabilities:** The probabilities reflect this confidence:\n    * `\"89\"`: Assigned a high probability (0.65) because this is the likely correct calculation based on the straightforward interpretation of the problem.\n    * `\"105\"`: Assigned a considerable probability (0.30) because it's plausible to arrive at this value with some misinterpretations or calculation errors.\n    * `\"5\"` & `\"5600\"`:  Given very low probabilities (0.02 and 0.03 respectively) because they are extremely unlikely given the values in the problem.\n\n* **`selected`:** The top two most probable answers are selected.\n",
