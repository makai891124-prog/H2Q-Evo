Since the answer is 1, we assign higher probability for option '1'. The second most probable answer is '5' because it looks like related with '10' & '9'.\n    *   `probs`: Probabilities are assigned to each option. '1' receives the highest probability (0.6), followed by '5' (0.2), with the remaining probability distributed to the other less likely options ('105' and '5600'). The probabilities sum to 1.\n    * `selected`: the top 2 most probable answers are selected.\n\n",
