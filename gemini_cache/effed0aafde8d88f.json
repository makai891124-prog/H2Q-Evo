It's assigned the highest probability (0.5) and ranked first.\n    *   **105 (idx 0):** It seems like a possible distractractor. It has a reasonable probability (0.35) and ranked second. I think, it might be caused by the misunderstanding of how to calculate profit.\n    *   **5600 (idx 2) and 5 (idx 1):** These are less likely to be chosen, so they receive lower probabilities.\n\n3.  **Selected:**\n\n    *   The `selected` array contains the indices of the two most probable answers: 3 (539) and 0 (105).\n",
