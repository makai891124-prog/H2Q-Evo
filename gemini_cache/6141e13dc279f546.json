After her friend saw the fairies, there were 50+25 = 75 fairies, ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. Therefore, 75 + 30 = 105.\n\n*   **`selected`: `[0, 1]`**\n    *   We select the two most plausible answers: \"105\" (index 0) and \"45\" (index 1).\n*   **`ranked`: `[0, 1, 3, 2]`**\n    *   Ranks the options by how likely they are to be the correct answer, from most to least likely:\n        *   \"105\" (index 0) - Most likely as it followed all prompts\n        *   \"45\" (index 1) - Second likely, given the math and potential to have missed adding 30\n        *   \"5\" (index 3) - Less likely.\n        *   \"5600\" (index 2) - Highly implausible, seems random.\n*   **`probs`: `[0.6, 0.3, 0.05, 0.05]`**\n    *   Represents the probability of each option being correct, summing to 1:\n        *   \"105\" - 60% probability\n        *   \"45\" - 30% probability\n        *   \"5\" - 5% probability\n        *   \"5600\" - 5% probability\n",
