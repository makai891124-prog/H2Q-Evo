The probabilities reflect the ranking. Option at index 1 (13) has the highest probability (0.60), followed by index 3 (5) with 0.33. The other options have very low probabilities.  These values are chosen to exemplify the ranking order - you could alter them and still adhere to the requirements.\n",
