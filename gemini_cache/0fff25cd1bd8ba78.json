The other option that has relevance is '5' if we misread the question as what is half of the number of letters in Indras' name + the result of subtracting 4 from it, which would result in half of 6 = 3, 3-4= -1. Since the result is -1, we can take the absolute value and that would lead to a result of 1+4, so 5.\n\n*   **`selected`:**  [1, 3] - The indices of the top 2 most likely answers (13 and 5).\n\n*   **`ranked`:** [1, 3, 0, 2] - The indices of all options, ranked from most to least likely (13, 5, 105, and 5600).\n\n*   **`probs`:** [0.05, 0.6, 0.01, 0.34] -  A probability distribution representing the confidence level for each option.  `13` (index 1) has the highest probability (0.6), indicating the highest confidence. '5' (index 3) has the second highest (0.34). '105' and '5600' have very low probabilities (0.05 and 0.01 respectively) since they are clearly incorrect given the problem.  The probabilities sum to 1.\n",
