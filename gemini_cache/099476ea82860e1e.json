These probabilities sum to 1.  The higher the probability, the more confident the model is that the option is relevant to how new polyomaviruses are detailed. Shotgun has highest confidence, NGS second highest, then human neural cells, then monoclonal antibody techniques.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nBased on common practices in virology and genomics:\n\n*   **Shotgun sequencing and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) (Deep pyro sequencing):** These are high-throughput sequencing methods crucial for identifying and characterizing novel viruses, including polyomaviruses. They enable rapid and comprehensive genome analysis.\n*   **Cultivation in human neural cells:** While cell culture is important in virology, specific neural cell cultivation isn't a *primary* method for initial *identification* and detailed description of *new* polyomaviruses. It's more relevant for studying their tropism and pathogenic mechanisms *after* they have been identified.\n*   **Monoclonal antibody techniques:** These are used for detecting and studying viral antigens. Useful after the virus has been identified, not primary for discovering new ones, although can sometimes be used for typing new isolates once the general viral family is known.\n\nTherefore, sequencing techniques are the most important, hence the higher probabilities.\n",
