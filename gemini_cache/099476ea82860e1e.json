These are both modern sequencing techniques used for viral discovery and characterization.\n\n* **`ranked`: [0, 2, 1, 3]`**\n    * This provides the order of likelihood from highest to lowest:\n        * `0`: Shot gun sequencing (Highest confidence - common for viral discovery)\n        * `2`: Deep pyro sequencing (NGS) (Second highest - another powerful sequencing method)\n        * `1`: Cultivation in human neural cells (Less likely - polyomaviruses don't always readily grow in cell culture, and neural cells are specifically only for some subtypes)\n        * `3`: Monoclonal antibody techniques (Least likely - while useful for *characterizing* already identified viruses, they aren't typically the primary method for initial detailing or discovery of *new* viruses).\n\n* **`probs`: [0.4, 0.1, 0.3, 0.2]`**\n    * This assigns probabilities to each option, reflecting the confidence levels in their relevance.  The probabilities sum to 1:\n        * `0.4`:  Shot gun sequencing (40% probability)\n        * `0.1`:  Cultivation in human neural cells (10% probability)\n        * `0.3`:  Deep pyro sequencing (NGS) (30% probability)\n        * `0.2`:  Monoclonal antibody techniques (20% probability)\n\n**Why this ranking?**\n\n* **Sequencing is Key:**  Modern virology relies heavily on sequencing technologies (like shotgun and NGS) to identify and characterize new viruses.  These methods allow for the rapid analysis of viral genomes directly from clinical samples or environmental sources.\n* **Cell Culture Limitations:**  While cell culture is still important, many viruses are difficult to grow *de novo* in the lab, especially without prior knowledge of their host range and specific cellular requirements.\n* **Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs):** mAbs are excellent for *characterizing* viruses (e.g., identifying specific proteins, mapping epitopes), but they are less useful as a starting point for *discovering* new viruses.  You need to have *something* to make the antibody against.\n",
