He pays 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours.  He adds 5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos. His total cost is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos. If he paid for the 24-hour stay, it would have been 1600 pesos. Therefore, he saves 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.\n\n* **`selected`:** The top two most likely answers are \"250\" and \"105\".\n\n* **`ranked`:** The answers are ranked from most likely to least likely based on the problem analysis.\n\n* **`probs`:** The probabilities are assigned to each option based on the likelihood of each answer being correct. I've assigned the highest probability to \"250\" as it's the correct answer. \"105\" is a plausible intermediate result (if someone miscalculated the additional hours to be 1.5), and then \"5600\" and \"5\" seem arbitrary and very less likely. The probabilities sum up to 1.\n",
