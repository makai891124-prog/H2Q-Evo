He pays 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours and then 70 pesos for each of the remaining 5 hours. That's 1000 + (5 * 70) = 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.  If he had chosen the 24-hour option, it would have cost 1600 pesos. Therefore, he saves 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.\n\n* **Ranking and Selection:**\n    * `\"250\"` is the correct answer and thus ranked highest.\n    * `\"105\"` :Cameron spends 5 hours beyond the initial 12 and pays 70 pesos an hour, resulting in an extra 350 pesos, and  1000/10 is 100, close to 105, thus ranked second.\n    * `\"5600\"`: This is a distractor, it might be calculated by 1600/100*350, thus ranked third.\n    * `\"5\"`:  This represents the 5 hours beyond the initial 12.\n\n* **Probabilities:** The `probs` array reflects the estimated likelihood of each option being correct based on the analysis above.  The correct answer (`\"250\"`) has the highest probability (0.65), followed by the second most plausible option, and so on. The sum of the probabilities is 1.\n\n**Calculation Breakdown:**\n\n1. **Total Hours:** 5 PM to 10 AM the next day is 17 hours.\n2. **Cost with Hourly Rate:** 1000 pesos (for 12 hours) + 5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.\n3. **Savings:** 1600 pesos (24-hour rate) - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.\n",
