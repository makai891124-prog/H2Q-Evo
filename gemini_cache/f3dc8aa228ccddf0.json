He spends $100, leaving him with $210 - $100 = $110.  Therefore, '110' (index 1) is the correct answer. The second most likely answer is '105' (index 0), which is close to the correct answer.  We select these top two.\n*   **ranked:** '110' (index 1) is ranked highest as the most likely correct answer. '105' (index 0) is ranked second. '5' (index 3) is a less likely answer, and '5600' (index 2) is highly unlikely and ranked last.\n*   **probs:**  These represent the probabilities (or confidence levels) associated with each option.  '110' has the highest probability (0.45), followed by '105' (0.35).  '5' (0.15) has a small probability and '5600' (0.05) has a very low probability. The probabilities sum to 1.\n",
