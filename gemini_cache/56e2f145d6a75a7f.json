Total cost is $12 + $24 = $36.\n* **`selected`:**  The correct answer, '36' (index 1), is the most likely.  Since the question asked for the cost of items, and only '36' and '109' are plausible dollar amounts, we'll include '109'(index 3) in the selected since it's within the top 2.\n* **`ranked`:**\n    * '36' (index 1) is ranked highest as it is the correct answer.\n    * '109' (index 3) is ranked second, while not the answer but having more face value than 0 and 5 which were obviously out of place.\n    * '5' (index 0) and '120' (index 2) are ranked last since they are incorrect and further from the correct answer.\n* **`probs`:**  Probabilities are assigned based on the ranking. The correct answer, '36' (index 1), gets a very high probability (0.997). The remaining probabilities are distributed across the other options so that the probabilities sum to 1.  '109'(index 3) will have a smaller non-zero value while '5' and '120' have near-zero probability.\n",
