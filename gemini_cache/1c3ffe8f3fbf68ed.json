Measurement would involve measuring angles of refraction, while observation would involve visually observing the colors.\n*   **ranked:** This reflects the order of the likely methods from most to least useful: Measurement, Observation, Research, Interviews.  Research (0) could provide background information, but is less directly involved in data collection. Interviews (1) are unlikely to be relevant to this experiment.\n*   **probs:**  These are probabilities assigned to each method, summing to 1.  Measurement is given the highest probability (0.5), followed by observation (0.4), then a smaller probability for research and interviews (0.05 each). The goal is to represent the confidence level in each method's likelihood of being used for data collection.\n",
