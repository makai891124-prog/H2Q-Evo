The correct answer (312) gets the highest probability, followed by a plausible calculation mistake (105), and then the least likely options (5600 and 5).\n\n**Note:**  While this response attempts to provide a reasonable JSON output based on the instructions and problem, accurately assessing \"置信度 (confidence)\" without the actual calculation process being provided or some underlying reasoning tool is challenging. The probabilities are estimations based on the likelihood of common mistakes, which can have high variability. The numbers will likely be different for a different AI.\n",
