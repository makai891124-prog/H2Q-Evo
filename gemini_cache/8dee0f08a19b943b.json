Then the longer piece is `4x` feet long.\n    *   The total length is `x + 4x = 40` feet.\n    *   This simplifies to `5x = 40`, so `x = 8` feet.\n    *   The longer piece is `4x = 4 * 8 = 32` feet.\n\n    Therefore:\n\n    *   '32' is the correct answer and has the highest confidence.\n    *   '5' comes from the equation  `5x = 40`, but it's not the final answer, so it has the second highest confidence.\n    *   The other options are clearly incorrect.\n\n*   **`selected`:**  The two options with the highest probabilities ('32' and '5') are selected. The index of '32' is 2 and '5' is 3 in the option list.\n*   **`ranked`:** The options are ranked by probability in descending order: '32', '5', '105', '5600'. The indices corresponding to these options in the original options list are: 2, 3, 0, 1.\n*   **`probs`:** Probabilities are assigned based on the reasoning.\n    *   '32' has the highest probability (0.73) as it's the correct answer.\n    *   '5' has a lower probability (0.20) because it represents an intermediate step in the calculation.\n    *   '105' and '5600' are given very low probabilities (0.05 and 0.02 respectively) as they are nonsensical in the context of the problem.\n    *   The probabilities sum to 1.0.\n",
