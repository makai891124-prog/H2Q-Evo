Therefore, 3 and 2 are the most plausible options.\n*   **ranked:** Based on the relative likelihood, the options are ranked as follows: step 3 (Implementation) being most likely, followed by step 2 (Development), step 4 (Review and Evaluation), and step 1 (Planning).\n*   **probs:** The probabilities reflect the confidence levels assigned to each step, with higher probabilities given to more plausible steps and such probabilities sum to 1.\n",
