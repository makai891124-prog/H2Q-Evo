A thorough analysis might reveal the source of the discrepancy.\n    * `3`: \"repeat the investigation two more times\" - Repeating the experiment allows for more data points and helps determine if the results are consistent. Multiple trials reduce the impact of random errors.\n    * `2`: \"ask a scientist what went wrong\" - While consulting a scientist can be helpful, it's generally better to first analyze the data and repeat the experiment.  A scientist will likely ask about these steps before offering specific guidance.\n    * `0`: \"try a different juice\" - Using a different juice is unlikely to address the core issue of inconsistent results between experiments. The goal is to understand why the same juice yields different vitamin C levels when tested by different groups using the same method.\n\n* **probs:**\n    * The probabilities reflect the relative likelihood of each option being the most important action to take. The probabilities sum to 1. Analyzing the data is given the highest probability, followed by repeating the investigation. The other two options are less directly relevant to improving the accuracy of the results and are assigned lower probabilities.\n",
