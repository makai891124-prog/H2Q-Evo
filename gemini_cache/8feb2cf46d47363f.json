The probabilities should sum to 1. The probability distribution is subjective to the LLM.\n\n4.  **JSON Format:**\n\n    *   The JSON output follows the specified format: `{\"selected\":[idx...],\"ranked\":[idx...],\"probs\":[p1..]}`.\n    *   `selected` contains the indices of the top 2 ranked options.\n    *   `ranked` contains the indices of all options in descending order of confidence.\n    *   `probs` contains the probabilities for each option, corresponding to the order of the options in the input list.\n",
