We assign the highest probability to it.\n   * '105' (Option 0) is a somewhat plausible incorrect answer. It might arise from adding all the numbers together without properly accounting for what was stolen.\n   * '5' (Option 1) and '5600' (Option 2) are completely unreasonable given the context of the problem.\n\n3. **Probabilities:**\n   * '43' (Option 3) gets a high probability (0.6).\n   * '105' (Option 0) gets a moderate probability (0.3).\n   * The other options get low probabilities (0.05).  These values are assigned to make the probabilities sum to 1.\n\n4. **Selected:**\n    *  The `selected` array contains the indices of the top 2 ranked options based on the probability distribution, i.e., 3 and 0.\n",
