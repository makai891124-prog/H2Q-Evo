Remaining: 48 - 24 = 24 bananas.\n   * Gunther adds 25: 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.\n   * Arnold steals 12: 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.\n   * Gunther adds 6: 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.\n\n   Therefore, the correct answer is 43.\n\n2. **Ranking and Probability Assignment (Explanation of the Probabilities):**\n\n   * **43:** This is the correct answer. We assign the highest probability to it (0.65).\n\n   * **105:** This is a somewhat plausible but incorrect answer.  It's possible someone might misinterpret the problem or add all the numbers together incorrectly. Assign a middling probability (0.25).\n\n   * **5, 5600:** These are highly unlikely answers, likely resulting from significant miscalculations or misunderstandings of the problem. Assign very low probabilities to them (0.05 each).\n\n3. **JSON Format:**\n\n   * `\"selected\"`: Contains the indices of the top two most likely answers based on the probability ranking (indices 3 and 0 correspond to answers '43' and '105').\n   * `\"ranked\"`: Contains the indices of all the options, ranked in descending order of their probabilities (from most likely to least likely).\n   * `\"probs\"`: Contains the probabilities assigned to each option. The sum of these probabilities must equal 1.\n",
