The probabilities are assigned subjectively based on the confidence ranking, ensuring they sum to 1.\n    * 420 (index 3) & 105(index 0): Assigned higher probabilities due to their relative plausibility given potential errors during calculation.\n    * 5600 & 5 are assigned lower probabilities due to their high implausibility.\n",
