It is important to note that the probabilities are assigned based on an assumed reasonable approach to solving the problem, and is not a calculation based on user data.\n\n*   \"452\":  Highest probability (0.85) as it's the calculated correct answer.\n*   \"475\":  Second highest probability (0.07), it could be possible due to the calculation error: 480-5\n*   \"105\":  Lower probability (0.05) as it doesn't directly relate to a valid calculation.\n*   \"5\": Lowest probability (0.03) it only refers to waking up early.\n\n3.  **Selected:**\n\nContains the top 2 choices based on their `ranked` positions.\n\n4.  **Ranked:**\n\nOrders the options from most probable to least probable.  Since the probability of \"452\" is the highest, it comes first, followed by others.",
