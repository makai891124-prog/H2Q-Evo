However, this option is most plausible in comparison to the rest.\n\n* **ranked:** The ranking is based on the reasoning above:\n    * **0:** Most likely.\n    * **3:** Second most likely, but not nearly as likely as 0.\n    * **1: Warbler breeding season will start earlier.**  There's no direct link between fewer females and an earlier breeding season. Environmental cues (temperature, day length) primarily drive breeding season timing. This is unlikely.\n    * **2: Warblers will have a larger selection of mates.**  Fewer females would mean *fewer* potential mates for males, not a larger selection. This is the least likely option.\n\n* **probs:**  The probabilities reflect the ranked order and the strength of the reasoning:\n    * 0.6 - Represents high confidence that option 0 is correct.\n    * 0.15 - Represents moderate confidence that option 3 could be correct.\n    * 0.15 - Represents low confidence that option 1 is correct.\n    * 0.1 - Represents low confidence that option 2 is correct.\n\n**Reasoning behind the probability distribution:**\n\nThe probabilities sum to 1 to represent the total certainty that one or more of the options are correct. The distribution favors option 0 because it's the most direct and logical consequence of the given scenario. Options 3 is a possible (but weaker) consequence. Options 1 and 2 are very unlikely, hence the low probabilities.\n",
