Left: 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas.\n    *   Football team ordered: 20 * 2 = 40 pizzas. Ate: 40 * 0.8 = 32 pizzas. Left: 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas.\n    *   Total pizzas left: 6 + 8 = 14 pizzas.\n\n*   **`selected`**: The correct answer is 14. \"5\" is next most plausible because it could be derived from a misunderstanding of the problem (e.g., incorrectly calculating the remaining pizzas for one of the groups).\n\n*   **`ranked`**: Orders the options by likelihood of being the correct answer, from highest to lowest.  The logic is that 14 is the correct answer, 5 is plausible given errors, and the other options are less likely.\n\n*   **`probs`**: Assigns probabilities to each option, summing up to 1.  These probabilities reflect the confidence in each option being correct.  14 has the highest probability, followed by 5, then 105, and finally 5600, reflecting decreasing plausibility. I have set the probability of the correct answer at 0.65 to be significantly higher than the other options.",
