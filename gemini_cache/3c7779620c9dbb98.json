The relative ranking among these is based on plausibility (e.g., \"5\" being closer to the right order of magnitude than \"5600\" or \"105\").\n    *   The probabilities are set such that their sum equals 1.\n4.  **Selected:** We take the top 2 ranked indices (4 and 3) as the selected options.  Note that the question instructions only specify returning the index, so it is the index (starting from 1), not the actual option string.\n",
