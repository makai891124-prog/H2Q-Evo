The two most plausible ranges are '100 and 299' (index 0) and '300 and 499' (index 1).\n* **ranked:** The ranges are ranked based on how likely they are to contain the correct answer. 197 falls most confidently within '100 and 299', followed by '300 and 499', then less likely '500 and 699', and least likely '700 and 899'.\n* **probs:** Probabilities assigned to each range, reflecting the confidence in each range containing the correct answer. These probabilities are subjective estimations based on the calculation.  '100 and 299' is given a high probability (0.7), '300 and 499' a lower one (0.25), and the other two ranges very small probabilities (0.03 and 0.02) to ensure the sum equals 1.  These values are chosen to reflect the ranking order.\n",
