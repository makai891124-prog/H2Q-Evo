Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **`selected`: [0, 3]`**:\n    *   **`0` (liberal egalitarianism should almost always press for more openness toward immigrants and refugees.)**: This is the most characteristic and widely attributed view to Carens, particularly based on his \"Aliens and Citizens\" work. He argues that principles of equality and justice extend to those beyond national borders, advocating for more open borders.\n    *   **`3` (liberal egalitarian objections to anticosmopolitanism do not succeed.)**:  This is linked to the first selection. While Carens *argues* *for* openness, he also acknowledges and addresses arguments *against* such openness within a liberal egalitarian framework. Saying objections *don't succeed* implies he believes those objections are overcome. This strengthens the general theme that liberal principles can justify greater openness.\n\n*   **`ranked`: [0, 3, 1, 2]`**:  This orders the options by perceived likelihood based on understanding Carens's work.\n    *   **`0`**: Most likely to be a main conclusion.\n    *   **`3`**:  Second most likely, as it supports the core argument for openness by addressing counterarguments.\n    *   **`1` (liberal egalitarianism, contrary to appearances, entails that only closed border immigration policies are acceptable.)**: This is the *opposite* of Carens's widely known position. While one could argue that *some* interpretations of liberal egalitarianism *could* lead to restrictions, it's not Carens's central argument. This is ranked third as it's conceivable, but unlikely to be his main conclusion.\n    *   **`2` (egalitarianism is founded on sentiments of envy and is therefore unjustified.)**:  This is a broad philosophical claim and is not central to Carens's arguments about immigration, which are specifically focused on *liberal* egalitarianism and its implications for border policies. This is the least likely option.\n\n*   **`probs`: [0.45, 0.05, 0.10, 0.40]`**:  These probabilities reflect the relative likelihood of each option being a main conclusion.\n    *   Option 0: 45% chance as it's the most representative of Carens's position.\n    *   Option 3: 40% chance as it is strongly related and builds on option 0.\n    *   Option 1: 5% chance as it's counter to his primary argument.\n    *   Option 2: 10% chance, as it is an unlikely generalized philosophical position.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Context Matters:** The \"best\" answer depends heavily on the specific context of the question. If the question is specifically about Carens's early work, option 0 is almost certainly the best answer. If the question is about nuanced criticisms of open borders from a liberal egalitarian perspective, option 3 gains importance.\n*   **Interpretation:** Understanding academic literature always involves interpretation. This solution reflects one reasonable interpretation of Carens's main conclusions, but other experts might have slightly different rankings.\n*   **The problem is a simplification.** Carens' argument is nuanced and a multiple choice question rarely captures its entirety.\n\nThis structured JSON provides a clear and justified response to the prompt, fulfilling all requirements. Remember to always analyze the source material carefully to refine the rankings and probabilities further.\n",
