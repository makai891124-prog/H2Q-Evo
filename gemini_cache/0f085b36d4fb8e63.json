The reaction should be nonspontaneous at 298 K, and this option is incorrect.\n\n    * **Option 1: 'ΔH > 0, ΔS < 0, and ΔG > 0'**: With a positive ΔH and negative ΔS, ΔG will always be positive, regardless of temperature. This means the reaction will always be non-spontaneous. The problem specifies that the reaction becomes spontaneous at lower temperature, and this option is incorrect.\n\n    * **Option 2: 'ΔH < 0, ΔS < 0, and ΔG > 0'**: With a negative ΔH and negative ΔS, at higher temperatures, the TΔS term becomes more significant, making ΔG less negative. However, this also means the reaction can be spontaneous at low temperature, matching the description of the problem, where the reaction becomes spontaneous at dry ice temperature.\n\n    * **Option 3: 'ΔH > 0, ΔS > 0, and ΔG > 0'**:  With a positive ΔH and positive ΔS, at higher temperatures, the TΔS term becomes more significant, making ΔG less positive, or even negative. The reaction will be spontaneous at high temperature. Since the reaction is nonspontaneous at 298 K, there must be a turning point to be spontaneous at high temperature. Thus, the Gibbs free energy must be less than 0 when the temperature is significantly higher, and this means the reaction is not always > 0, contradicting the option description.\n\n* **Ranking and Selection:**\n\n    * **Option 3 (ΔH > 0, ΔS > 0, and ΔG > 0)** is most likely correct. The reaction is favored entropically but not enthalpically.\n    * **Option 1 (ΔH > 0, ΔS < 0, and ΔG > 0)** is less possible but not impossible. The reaction is not favored entropically nor enthalpically.\n    * Options 0 and 2 are not possible.\n\n* **Probabilities:**  The probabilities reflect the ranking. Option 3 is given the highest probability.\n",
