In this case, these are '24' and '5'.\n* **`ranked`: [2, 3, 0, 1]`**:  This is the order of the options based on the model's confidence, from most confident to least confident.  '24' (index 2) is ranked first, then '5' (index 3), then '105' (index 0), and finally '5600' (index 1). The most likely answer is '24' which is three times of two times of Chris, which is 4.\n* **`probs`: [0.01, 0.01, 0.97, 0.01]`**: These are the probabilities assigned to each option.  Notice they sum to 1 (100%). '24' has a very high probability (0.97), indicating high confidence in its correctness. The other options have very low probabilities (0.01).\n",
