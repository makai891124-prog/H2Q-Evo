Since only two are needed, the rest of the results are discarded.\n*   **`ranked`: [2, 1, 0, 3]`**: This array represents the order of the options from most likely to least likely. `2` ( \"276000\") is ranked highest, followed by `1` (\"5600\"), then `0` (\"105\"), and lastly `3` (\"5\").\n*   **`probs`: [0.01, 0.24, 0.74, 0.01]`**: This array contains the probability assigned to each option.\n\n    *   $20,000 * 12 = $240,000 (cost of the cars)\n    *   $240,000 * 0.10 = $24,000 (tax)\n    *   $1,000 * 12 = $12,000 (registration)\n    *   $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000 (total cost)\n\n    Therefore, \"276000\" is the correct solution, and option 1: \"5600\" matches the registration fee plus the tax, which is a reasonable partial solution.\n",
