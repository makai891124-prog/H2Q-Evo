The next most plausible is \"105\", which seems related to 150, so the first two ranked answers, '540' (index 3) and '105' (index 0) are chosen as 'selected'.\n\n*   **ranked:**\n    *   Index 3 ('540') is the most likely answer as it's the correct calculation.\n    *   Index 0 ('105') is ranked second as it might represent a miscalculation or part of the calculation.\n    *   Index 1 ('5') and Index 2 ('5600') are ranked last as they are least likely to relate to the question given the numbers involved.\n\n*   **probs:**  The probabilities reflect the ranking:\n    *   '540' has the highest probability (0.6).\n    *   '105' has a medium probability(0.3).\n    *   '5' and '5600' have low probabilities (0.05 each).\n\n    The probabilities sum to 1.\n",
