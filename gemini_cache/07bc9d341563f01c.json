Negative reinforcement is highly related. Loss of a positive reinforcer is also core to time-out. Differential reinforcement is a broader concept, and stimulus generalization is the least relevant.\n* **probs:** `[0.35, 0.10, 0.40, 0.15]` - These probabilities represent the estimated likelihood of each option being a correct answer.  They sum to 1 and are ordered to match the initial options.  \"Negative reinforcement\" has the highest probability, followed by \"oval of a positive reinforcer\", then \"differential reinforcement\" and lastly \"stimulus generalization\". Note that the index used here is based on the prompt description.\n",
