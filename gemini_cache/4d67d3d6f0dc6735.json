Therefore selected are \\[3, 1].\n\n3.  **Ranked:**\n    *   Based on the calculation, '60' (index 3) is the most confident answer.\n    *   The value '5' is selected as it represents either the number of students or a portion of the wrong calculation, so it is ranked second.\n    *   The other two values '105' and '5600' has no relation to the problem, therefore ranked last.\n\n4.  **Probs:**\n    *   Assign probabilities based on confidence. '60' (index 3) gets the highest probability.\n    *   '5' (index 1) also gets a considerable probability because it represents an intermediate value that could be mistaken for the final answer.\n    *   '105' (index 0) and '5600' (index 2) are very unlikely answers and are given very low probabilities.\n    *   All probabilities must add up to 1.\n",
