The correct answer is 60. We first calculate contemporary: 20 * 20% = 4 students.  Remaining students: 20 - 4 = 16.  Jazz: 16 * 25% = 4 students.  Hip-hop: 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.  Percentage of hip-hop: (12/20) * 100% = 60%. 5 is incorrect, but numerically closer to 60 than the other options and represents the contemporary number of students as a percentage.\n* **ranked:** The options are ranked by likelihood in descending order. '60' is the most likely, followed by '5'. '105' and '5600' are highly unlikely.\n* **probs:** These represent the probability (confidence) assigned to each option. '60' gets a high probability of 0.5. '5' gets a slightly less high probability of 0.49. '105' and '5600' get negligible probabilities. The probabilities sum to 1.0.\n",
